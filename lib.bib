	abstract = {Background. Current evidence suggests that exposure to social-evaluative threat ({SET}) can elicit a physiological stress response, especially cortisol, which is an important regulatory hormone. However, an alternative explanation of these findings is that social-evaluative laboratory tasks are more difficult, or confer greater cognitive load, than non-evaluative tasks. Thus, the current experiment tested whether social-evaluative threat, rather than cognitive load, is truly an “active ingredient” in eliciting a cortisol response to stressors.
Methods. Healthy undergraduate students (N = 142, 65\% female) were randomly assigned to one of four speech-stressor conditions in a fully-crossed two (social-evaluative threat [{SET}] manipulation: non-{SET} versus {SET}) by two (cognitive load manipulation: low versus high) stressor manipulation. Social-evaluative threat was manipulated by the presence ({SET}) or absence (non-{SET}) of two evaluators, while cognitive load was manipulated by the presence ({LOAD}) or absence (non-{LOAD}) of a tone-counting task during the speech stressor. Salivary cortisol and cardiovascular measures were taken before, during, and after the speech stressor.
Results. Compared to the non-{SET} condition, {SET} condition led to greater cortisol and cardiovascular responses to the speech stressor. There were no main or additive effects of cognitive load on cortisol and cardiovascular responses to the speech stressor.
Conclusions. These findings suggest that social-evaluative threat is a central aspect of stressors that elicits a cortisol response; however we found no evidence that increased difficulty, or cognitive load, contributed to greater cardiovascular or cortisol responses to stressors.},

	shorttitle = {Transgender Population Size in the United States},
	abstract = {Background. Transgender individuals have a gender identity that differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. The population size of transgender individuals in the United States is not well-known, in part because official records, including the {US} Census, do not include data on gender identity. Population surveys today more often collect transgender-inclusive gender-identity data, and secular trends in culture and the media have created a somewhat more favorable environment for transgender people.
            Objectives. To estimate the current population size of transgender individuals in the United States and evaluate any trend over time.
            Search methods. In June and July 2016, we searched {PubMed}, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Web of Science for national surveys, as well as “gray” literature, through an Internet search. We limited the search to 2006 through 2016.
            Selection criteria. We selected population-based surveys that used probability sampling and included self-reported transgender-identity data.
            Data collection and analysis. We used random-effects meta-analysis to pool eligible surveys and used meta-regression to address our hypothesis that the transgender population size estimate would increase over time. We used subsample and leave-one-out analysis to assess for bias.
            Main results. Our meta-regression model, based on 12 surveys covering 2007 to 2015, explained 62.5\% of model heterogeneity, with a significant effect for each unit increase in survey year (F = 17.122; df = 1,10; b = 0.026\%; P = .002). Extrapolating these results to 2016 suggested a current {US} population size of 390 adults per 100 000, or almost 1 million adults nationally. This estimate may be more indicative for younger adults, who represented more than 50\% of the respondents in our analysis.
            Authors’ conclusions. Future national surveys are likely to observe higher numbers of transgender people. The large variety in questions used to ask about transgender identity may account for residual heterogeneity in our models.
            Public health implications. Under- or nonrepresentation of transgender individuals in population surveys is a barrier to understanding social determinants and health disparities faced by this population. We recommend using standardized questions to identify respondents with transgender and nonbinary gender identities, which will allow a more accurate population size estimate.},

	abstract = {Transgender people’s recent increase in visibility in the contemporary United States has presented new linguistic challenges. This article investigates those challenges and presents strategies developed by trans speakers and promoted by trans activists concerned with language reform. The first of these is the selection of gendered lexical items, including both gender identity terms (woman, man, etc.) and more implicitly gendered words (e.g. beautiful, handsome). The second is the assignment of third person pronouns like she/her/hers and he/ him/his as well as non-binary pronouns like singular they/them/theirs or ze/ hir/hirs. Both of these challenges tap into the importance trans people place on individual self-identification, and they come with new interactional practices such as asking people directly what pronouns they would like others to use when referring to them. The third challenge addressed here is avoiding gendering people when the referent’s gender isn’t relevant or known, which can be addressed through the selection of gender-neutral or gender-inclusive language. The final challenge is how to discuss gender when it is relevant – e.g. in discussions of gender identity, socialisation or sexual physiology – without delegitimising trans identities. Several strategies are presented to address this issue, such as hedging all generalisations based on gender, even when doing so seems unnecessary in the normative sex/gender framework or using more precise language regarding what aspect(s) of gender are relevant. Taken as a whole, trans language reform reflects the importance of language, not just as an auxiliary to identity, but as the primary grounds on which identity construction takes place.},

	abstract = {Some people have a gender which is neither male nor female and may identify as both male and female at one time, as different genders at different times, as no gender at all, or dispute the very idea of only two genders. The umbrella terms for such genders are ‘genderqueer’ or ‘non-binary’ genders. Such gender identities outside of the binary of female and male are increasingly being recognized in legal, medical and psychological systems and diagnostic classifications in line with the emerging presence and advocacy of these groups of people. Population-based studies show a small percentage – but a sizable proportion in terms of raw numbers – of people who identify as non-binary. While such genders have been extant historically and globally, they remain marginalized, and as such – while not being disorders or pathological in themselves – people with such genders remain at risk of victimization and of minority or marginalization stress as a result of discrimination. This paper therefore reviews the limited literature on this field and considers ways in which (mental) health professionals may assist the people with genderqueer and non-binary gender identities and/or expressions they may see in their practice.

Negative interactions were characterized by misgendering, unfamiliarity with {TGGNB} people and health issues, and transphobic practices. Participants wished providers understood their health concerns, did not expect their patients to educate them, and created a welcoming clinical environment.

Gender is widely discussed in the context of language tasks and when examining the stereotypes propagated by language models. However, current discussions primarily treat gender as binary, which can perpetuate harms such as the cyclical erasure of non-binary gender identities. These harms are driven by model and dataset biases, which are consequences of the non-recognition and lack of understanding of non-binary genders in society. In this paper, we explain the complexity of gender and language around it, and survey non-binary persons to understand harms associated with the treatment of gender as binary in English language technologies. We also detail how current language representations (e.g., {GloVe}, {BERT}) capture and perpetuate these harms and related challenges that need to be acknowledged and addressed for representations to equitably encode gender information.},

It is hypothesized that activating the mindset “think {diVerent}” by priming creativity prevents stereotypes and associations in general from becoming automatically activated. In two experiments a creative, a thoughtful or no mindset was activated. Afterwards, the activation of associations was measured using a lexical decision task with semantic priming. As predicted, the automatic activation of stereotypes (Study 1) and other associations (Study 2) was found in the control conditions but not in a creative mindset. These results suggest that people possess a mindset that allows for overcoming automatic stereotype activation without being tailored to a {speciWc} category.},

During age categorization, reaction times revealed signiﬁcant priming for both priming conditions, and event-related potentials yielded an increased N170 over the left hemisphere as a result of priming. During gender categorization, congruent faces elicited priming and a latency decrease in the right N170. Accordingly, information about age is extracted irrespective of processing demands, and priming facilitates the extraction of feature information reﬂected in the left N170 effect. By contrast, priming of gender categorization may depend on whether the task at initial presentation requires conﬁgural processing.},

We investigated whether related word-picture pairs resulted in faster reaction times in comparison to the neutral word-picture pairs (facilitation) and whether unrelated word-picture pairs resulted in slower reaction times in comparison to neutral word-picture pairs (interference). We further examined whether these effects (if any) map onto response conﬂict or aspects of target processing. In addition, identity (“man,” “woman”) and associative (“tie,” “dress”) primes were introduced to investigate the cognitive mechanisms of semantic and Stroop-like effects in response priming (introduced respectively by associations and identity words). We analyzed responses and reaction times using the drift diffusion model to examine the effect of facilitation and/or interference as a function of the prime type. We found that regardless of prime type words introduce a facilitatory effect, which maps to the processes of visual attention and response execution.},

	abstract = {Across three studies people miscategorised transgender individuals through degendering (abstention of pronouns) and misgendering (using gender inconsistent pronouns). Participants described and evaluated an individual who either disclosed a transgender identity or did not in an interpersonal context. In Study 1 (N = 203), men were more likely to misgender a woman who identified as transgender (vs. did not) and were less likely to explicitly categorise her as a woman. In Studies 2 (N = 600) and 3 (N = 593), participants were more likely to misgender and degender transgender women and men (vs. controls). In Study 3, participants who learned a person’s pronoun were less likely to degender transgender women. However, providing pronouns did not result in sig­ nificantly less misgendering overall, nor did it mitigate the degendering of transgender men. Misgendering was a stronger predictor of social con­ nectedness and social categorisation (Study 1) than explicit gender incon­ sistent categorisations. Misgendering is an insidious indirect form of miscategorisation, more strongly predicting negative social consequences than direct explicit categorisation. While listing one’s pronouns mitigates some pronoun disparities, it is not a cure-all for degendering and misgendering.},

Furthermore, we find that the stereotypes of the various categories that are mapped to racially mixed faces are distinct, underscoring the importance of understanding how mixed-race targets are spontaneously categorized.

Our results suggest that, when allowed, observers often classify Black–White faces into alternative categories (i.e., responses that are neither the parent races nor their combination), such as Hispanic and Middle Eastern. Furthermore, we find that the stereotypes of the various categories that are mapped to racially mixed faces are distinct, underscoring the importance of understanding how mixed-race targets are spontaneously categorized. Our findings speak to the challenges associated with racial categorization in an increasingly racially diverse population, including discrepancies between target racial identities and their racial categorizations by observers as well as variable stereotype application to mixed-race targets.},

However, many studies involve at least two random factors (e.g., participants and the targets to which they respond, such as words, pictures, or individuals). The application of traditional analytic methods to the data from such studies can result in serious bias in testing experimental effects. In this review, we develop a comprehensive typology of designs involving two random factors, which may be either crossed or nested, and one ﬁxed factor, condition. We present appropriate linear mixed models for all designs and develop effect size measures. We provide the tools for power estimation for all designs. We then discuss issues of design choice, highlighting power and feasibility considerations. Our goal is to encourage appropriate analytic methods that produce replicable results for studies involving new samples of both participants and targets.},

	abstract = {Exposure to a face can produce biases in the perception of subsequent faces. Typically, these face aftereffects are studied by adapting to an individual face or category (e.g., faces of a given gender) and can result in renormalization of perceptions such that the adapting face appears more neutral. These shifts are analogous to chromatic adaptation, where a renormalization for the average adapting color occurs. However, in color vision, adaptation can also adjust to the variance or range of colors in the distribution. We examined whether this variance or contrast adaptation also occurs for faces, using an objective {EEG} measure to assess response changes following adaptation. An average female face was contracted or expanded along the horizontal or vertical axis to form four images. Observers viewed a 20 s sequence of the four images presented in a ﬁxed order at a rate of 6 Hz, while responses to the faces were recorded with {EEG}. A 6 Hz signal was observed over right occipito-temporal channels, indicating symmetric responses to the four images. This test sequence was repeated after 20 s adaptation to alternations between two of the faces (e.g., horizontal contracted and expanded). This adaptation resulted in an additional signal at 3 Hz, consistent with asymmetric responses to adapted and non-adapted test faces. Adapting pairs have the same mean (undistorted) as the test sequence and thus should not bias responses driven only by the mean. Instead, the results are consistent with selective adaptation to the distortion axis. A 3 Hz signal was also observed after adapting to face pairs selected to induce a mean bias (e.g., expanded vertical and expanded horizontal), and this signal was not signiﬁcantly different from that observed following adaption to a single image that did not form part of the test sequence (e.g., a single image expanded both vertically and horizontally). In a further experiment, we found that this variance adaptation can also be observed behaviorally. Our results suggest that adaptation calibrates face perception not only for the average characteristics of the faces we experience but also for the gamut of faces to which we are exposed.},

According to this criterion, if a high-level property (for example, an emotional expression) is susceptible to after-effects, this suggests that the property can be perceived, rather than cognized. The defenders of the criterion claim that, since after-effects are also present for low-level, uncontroversially perceptual properties (such as orientation), we can safely infer that high-level aftereffects are perceptual as well. The critics of the criterion, on the other hand, assimilate it to superficially similar effects in cognition (such as decision biases) and argue that the after-effect criterion is a cognitive phenomenon rather than a perceptual one, and that as a result it is not a reliable guide for exploring the contents of perception. I argue against both of these views and show that high-level after-effects cannot be identified either with low-level after-effects or with cognitive biases. I suggest an intermediate position: high-level after-effects are not cognitive, but they are nonetheless not a good criterion for exploring the contents of perception.},

	abstract = {Some people have a gender which is neither male nor female and may identify as both male and female at one time, as different genders at different times, as no gender at all, or dispute the very idea of only two genders. The umbrella terms for such genders are ‘genderqueer’ or ‘non-binary’ genders. Such gender identities outside of the binary of female and male are increasingly being recognized in legal, medical and psychological systems and diagnostic classifications in line with the emerging presence and advocacy of these groups of people. Population-based studies show a small percentage – but a sizable proportion in terms of raw numbers – of people who identify as non-binary. While such genders have been extant historically and globally, they remain marginalized, and as such – while not being disorders or pathological in themselves – people with such genders remain at risk of victimization and of minority or marginalization stress as a result of discrimination. This paper therefore reviews the limited literature on this field and considers ways in which (mental) health professionals may assist the people with genderqueer and non-binary gender identities and/or expressions they may see in their practice.

The wording for the concept humanity was manipulated to be either a typical member of mankind, a typical human, or a typical man or woman (or woman or man). Overall, participants selected more White targets. Participants also selected more male targets, but the degree to which that was the case was affected by wording and participant’s gender. Participants, particularly male participants, in the mankind and human wording conditions were more likely to select a male target as representative, whereas in the man or woman condition, participants’ choices did not differ from chance.

In the four tasks, participants learned to classify faces divided on the basis of gender, hair color, a subjective determined level of ‘trust’, or at random. After category learning, participants rated the similarity of each pair of faces, and their judgments were compared to a previously collected ‘base rate’ set of similarities for the same stimuli. Evidence for learned categorical perception was then sought, in the form of increased diﬀerences between intra-category and inter-category similarities. Over the four conditions, we observed no learned categorical perception when categories were based on obvious properties (gender and hair color), nor when the category structure was intentionally random. However, when the loosely deﬁned category structure of trust was employed, a learned categorical perception eﬀect emerged.},

In a set of three experiments, we examine this hypothesis, first in a speeded gender classification experiment with male and female names presented in black and white. As expected, male names in black and female names in white are classified faster than the reverse gender-colour combinations. The second experiment relies on a gender classification task involving the disambiguation of very briefly appearing non-descript stimuli in the form of black and white ‘blobs’. The former are classified predominantly as male and the latter as female names. Finally, the processes driving light and dark object choices for males and females are examined by tracking the number of fixations and their duration in an eye-tracking experiment. The results reveal that when choosing for a male target, participants look longer and make more fixations on dark objects, and the same for light objects when choosing for a female target. The implications of these findings, which repeatedly reveal the same data patterns across experiments with Dutch, Portuguese and Turkish samples for the abstract category of gender, are discussed. The discussion attempts to enlarge the subject beyond mainstream models of embodied grounding.

	abstract = {In person perception research, femininity and masculinity are regularly conceived as two ends of one bipolar dimension. This unidimensional understanding permeates work on facial impressions, gender diagnosticity, and perceptions of {LGBTQ} individuals—but, it is perhaps most prominent in evolutionary work suggesting that sexually dimorphic facial features (which vary along a female–male continuum) correspond directly with subjective ratings of femininity and masculinity, which in turn predict ratings of traits such as attractiveness. In this paper, we analyze two large face databases (the Chicago and Bogazici Face Databases) to demonstrate that femininity and masculinity are distinct dimensions in person perception. We also evaluate key theoretical assumptions surrounding femininity and masculinity in evolutionary theories of face perception. We find that sexually dimorphic features weakly correlate with each other and typically explain just 10-20\% of variance in subjective ratings of femininity and masculinity. Femininity and masculinity each explain unique variance in trait ratings of attractiveness, dominance, trustworthiness, and threat. Femininity and masculinity also interact to explain unique variance in these traits, revealing facial androgyny as a novel phenomenon. We propose a new theoretical model explaining the link between biology, facial features, perceived femininity and masculinity, and trait ratings. Our findings broadly suggest that concepts that are “opposites” semantically cannot necessarily be assumed to be psychological opposites.},

Using this methodology, the present work aims to detect diﬀerential attentional processing of ingroup and outgroup members based on gender categories. Speciﬁcally, three {EEG} studies tested how factors that enhance social identity relevance, namely gender identiﬁcation and contextual salience of gender representation, moderate neural gender categorization eﬀects. Study 1 showed that both women (Study 1a) and men (Study 1b) were more likely to show preferential attention to ingroup over outgroup members, but only when they identiﬁed strongly with their gender group. Study 2 showed that when gender categories in an intergroup leadership context were made salient (i.e., when women were numerically underrepresented versus equally represented compared to men), women, irrespective of their level of gender identiﬁcation, showed preferential attention to ingroup over outgroup members. Together, this work provides empirical evidence for (1) the neural gender categorization eﬀect among both men and women as soon as 100 ms after face perception and (2) the moderating role of factors that enhance social identity relevance in early gender categorization.},

Over 6 studies (N {\textgreater} 6000), we develop a gender expression {IAT} and present evidence for its internal validity and incremental predictive validity with relevant psychosocial attitudes, such as need for closure, political ideology, and support for nonbinary affirming policies. Although the {IAT} consistently revealed more positive associations towards gender conforming than androgynous people and was reliably correlated with parallel measures of explicit attitudes, it failed to predict several behavioral outcomes related to gender expression in contexts like judgment, perceptual fluency, and mouse-tracking.

Both tasks elicited activations in the bilateral fusiform gyri (fusiform face area, {FFA}) and bilateral inferior occipital gyri (occipital face area, {OFA}). Importantly, the same stimuli elicited enhanced activation during gender as compared to age categorization. This enhancement was signiﬁcant in the right {FFA} and the left {OFA}, and may be related to increased conﬁgural processing.

How are these groups – verbally marked as atypical relative to their cisgender counterparts – stereotyped? Moreover, how do gender essentialist beliefs predict the content of such stereotypes? Across four studies with diverse methods of stereotype measurement, we assessed characteristics that cisgender people associate with transgender women and men, comparing these to their stereotypes of cisgender women and men. In our final study, we directly assessed how cisgender people mentally position transgender groups relative to cisgender groups. Across these studies, transgender categories were characterized in less positive ways than cisgender ones, and there was as a lower level of consensus about transgender than cisgender stereotypes. On average, transgender groups were de-gendered relative to cisgender groups, such that transgender women and men were not strongly differentiated on traditionally-gendered stereotype dimensions. Finally, we showed that participants higher in gender essentialism (relative to participants lower in gender essentialism) evaluated cisgender groups more positively and were more likely to stereotype transgender groups based on their sex assigned at birth.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Facial averageness and sexual dimorphism are extensively studied attractiveness markers, which are viewed as possible indicators of biological quality. Both are complex morphological traits, and both can be easily assessed from frontal and lateral projection of a human face. Interestingly, examination of mutual relations between the frontal and lateral dimensions of these markers has so far received little attention in published research.
Methods: In our cross-cultural study, we used geometric morphometric data from male and female faces from Brazil, Cameroon, Colombia, and the Czech Republic, and analyzed correlations between frontal and lateral measurements of averageness and degree of maleness/femaleness, that is, the individual variation in features that characterize sexual dimorphism. We also analyzed whether the association between frontal and lateral measurements differed in men and women.
Results: In general, our results showed a moderate correlation in sexually dimorphic features between lateral and frontal facial configuration in both sexes, while frontal and lateral facial averageness was moderately correlated only in women. This pattern was less consistent when individual populations were analyzed separately.
Conclusions: We suggest that, in general, the weak association between lateral and frontal facial configurations may be the result of selection pressures in favor of individual identity signals. Moreover, especially in women, the frontal and lateral dimension of a given facial attractiveness marker may provide similar information about the qualities of the individual. The absence of a significant correlation in male facial averageness suggests that frontal and lateral averageness convey different information about an individual.},

How are these groups – verbally marked as atypical relative to their cisgender counterparts – stereotyped? Moreover, how do gender essentialist beliefs predict the content of such stereotypes? Across four studies with diverse methods of stereotype measurement, we assessed characteristics that cisgender people associate with transgender women and men, comparing these to their stereotypes of cisgender women and men. In our final study, we directly assessed how cisgender people mentally position transgender groups relative to cisgender groups. Across these studies, transgender categories were characterized in less positive ways than cisgender ones, and there was as a lower level of consensus about transgender than cisgender stereotypes. On average, transgender groups were de-gendered relative to cisgender groups, such that transgender women and men were not strongly differentiated on traditionally-gendered stereotype dimensions. Finally, we showed that participants higher in gender essentialism (relative to participants lower in gender essentialism) evaluated cisgender groups more positively and were more likely to stereotype transgender groups based on their sex assigned at birth.},

Sixteen male faces were averaged to create a prototype male face and sixteen female faces averaged to create a prototype female face. The prototypes were then masked to exclude ears, neck, hair, and hairline. Individual features (brows, eyes, nose, mouth, and chin) and pairs of features (brows \& eyes, eyes \& nose, nose \& mouth, mouth \& chin) from the prototypes were then presented in isolation for classification according to their perceived gender. The results showed that, for the faces used, the brows \& eyes, brows alone, eyes alone, the whole jaw, the chin, the nose \& mouth, the mouth alone (in descending order), ie all the features except the nose, carried some information about gender when they were seen in isolation. In the second part of the experiment different features from one prototype face were grafted into the prototype of the opposite gender and the resulting composite faces classified by their perceived gender. The results of this feature substitution showed the jaw, brows \& eyes, chin, and brows (in descending order) effecting significant change in perceived gender. The difference in gender information carried by feature(s) when they were viewed in isolation from that when they were substituted for each other is attributed to the role of configuration in the perception of the gender of a face.},

In different blocks, participants performed age and gender classiﬁcations for old or young unfamiliar faces (50\% female respectively). Both tasks elicited activations in the bilateral fusiform gyri (fusiform face area, {FFA}) and bilateral inferior occipital gyri (occipital face area, {OFA}). Importantly, the same stimuli elicited enhanced activation during gender as compared to age categorization. This enhancement was signiﬁcant in the right {FFA} and the left {OFA}, and may be related to increased conﬁgural processing. Our ﬁndings replicate and extend recent work, and shows that the activation of core components of the face processing network is strongly dependent on task demands.},

During gender categorization, congruent faces elicited priming and a latency decrease in the right N170. Accordingly, information about age is extracted irrespective of processing demands, and priming facilitates the extraction of feature information reﬂected in the left N170 effect.

With this paper we publish a generative 3D shape and texture model, the Basel Face Model ({BFM}), and demonstrate its application to several face recognition task. We improve on previous models by oﬀering higher shape and texture accuracy due to a better scanning device and less correspondence artifacts due to an improved registration algorithm.},

	abstract = {General, spontaneous evaluations of strangers based on their faces have been shown to reflect judgments of these persons’ intention and ability to harm. These evaluations can be mapped onto a 2D space defined by the dimensions trustworthiness (intention) and dominance (ability). Here we go beyond general evaluations and focus on more specific personality judgments derived from the Big Two and Big Five personality concepts. In particular, we investigate whether Big Two/Big Five personality judgments can be mapped onto the 2D space defined by the dimensions trustworthiness and dominance. Results indicate that judgments of the Big Two personality dimensions almost perfectly map onto the 2D space. In contrast, at least 3 of the Big Five dimensions (i.e., neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness) go beyond the 2D space, indicating that additional dimensions are necessary to describe more specific face-based personality judgments accurately. Building on this evidence, we model the Big Two/Big Five personality dimensions in real facial photographs. Results from 2 validation studies show that the Big Two/Big Five are perceived reliably across different samples of faces and participants. Moreover, results reveal that participants differentiate reliably between the different Big Two/Big Five dimensions. Importantly, this high level of agreement and differentiation in personality judgments from faces likely creates a subjective reality which may have serious consequences for those being perceived—notably, these consequences ensue because the subjective reality is socially shared, irrespective of the judgments’ validity. The methodological approach introduced here might prove useful in various psychological disciplines.},

The neural basis of such categorical face perception remains virtually unknown. Participants passively viewed faces whose sexually dimorphic content was morphed monotonically from male to female while neural activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjective perceptions revealed strong nonlinearity despite monotonic linear changes in face gender, consistent with categorical perception. Neuroimaging results indicated that the lateral fusiform gyrus, bilaterally, and the fusiform face area linearly encoded graded parameters of objective face gender, but these regions correlated substantially less with subjective perceptions (which were nonlinear and affected by categorical perception effects). Such subjective perceptions, however, were represented in the orbitofrontal cortex, but this region correlated substantially less with objective parameters. The attention-independent graded representations of face gender in fusiform and orbitofrontal cortices reveal how objective face parameters are encoded and transformed into subjective categorically warped perceptions in the human brain.},

In the present study we used an adaptation paradigm with both imagined and perceived faces as adaptors, and assessed the aftereffects in judged masculinity/femininity when viewing an androgynous test face. We monitored eye movements and pupillary responses as a way to conﬁrm whether participants did actively engage in visual imagery. The results indicated that both perceptual and imagery adaptation produce aftereffects, but that they run in opposite directions: a contrast effect with perception (e.g., after visual exposure to a female face, the androgynous appears as more male) and an assimilation effect with imagery (e.g., after imaginative exposure to a female face, the androgynous face appears as more female). The pupillary responses revealed dilations consistent with increased cognitive effort during the imagery phase, suggesting that the assimilation aftereffect occurred in the presence of an active and effortful mental imagery process, as also witnessed by the pattern of eye movements recorded during the imagery adaptation phase.},

	abstract = {In two studies we disentangled and systematically investigated the impact of subtle facial cues to masculinity/femininity and gender category information on first impressions. Participants judged the same unambiguously male and female target persons–either with masculine or feminine facial features slightly enhanced–regarding stereotypically masculine (i.e., competence) and feminine (i.e., warmth) personality traits. Results of both studies showed a strong effect of facial masculinity/femininity: Masculine-looking persons were seen as colder and more competent than feminine-looking persons. This effect of facial masculinity/ femininity was not only found for typical (i.e., masculine-looking men and feminine-looking women) and atypical (i.e., masculine-looking women and feminine-looking men) category members; it was even found to be more pronounced for atypical than for typical category members. This finding reveals that comparing atypical members to the group prototype results in pronounced effects of facial masculinity/femininity. These contrast effects for atypical members predominate assimilation effects for typical members. Intriguingly, very subtle facial cues to masculinity/femininity strongly guide first impressions and may have more impact than the gender category.},

In the present study, we extended this line of research by investigating hiring decisions for both masculine- and feminine-typed professional roles. Furthermore, we used eye tracking to examine the visual exploration of applicants’ portraits. Our results indicate that masculine-looking applicants were favored for the masculine-typed role (leader) and feminine-looking applicants for the feminine-typed role (team member). Eye movement patterns showed that information about gender category and facial appearance was integrated during first fixations of the portraits. Hiring decisions, however, were not based on this initial analysis, but occurred at a second stage, when the portrait was viewed in the context of considering the applicant for a specific job.},

The effective achievement of altered states of consciousness in {EMs} was associated with an increase in the local θ- and α1 powers in the anterior cortical areas, as well as long-distance coherence between the prefrontal and posterior associative cortex with the formation of a center of gravity in the left prefrontal region (lead {AF}3). According to the data of the correlation analysis of the {EEG} power values and the data of subjective scaling of the meditation state, the θpower values were positively associated with positive emotional experiences and negatively associated with the level of mental activity. The results of this study are consistent with current concepts that the θ and α activities in narrow frequency bands reﬂect the activity of multifunctional neuronal networks selectively associated with processes of cognitive and affective activity.},

	abstract = {A working model of the neurophysiology of hypnosis suggests that highly hypnotizable individuals ({HHs}) have more effective frontal attentional systems implementing control, monitoring performance, and inhibiting unwanted stimuli from conscious awareness, than low hypnotizable individuals ({LHs}). Recent studies, using prepulse inhibition ({PPI}) of the auditory startle reflex ({ASR}), suggest that {HHs}, in the waking condition, may show reduced sensory gating although they may selectively attend and disattend different stimuli. Using a within subject design and a strict subject selection procedure, in waking and hypnosis conditions we tested whether {HHs} compared to {LHs} showed a significantly lower inhibition of the {ASR} and startle-related brain activity in both time and intracerebral source localization domains. {HHs}, as compared to {LH} participants, exhibited (a) longer latency of the eyeblink startle reflex, (b) reduced N100 responses to startle stimuli, and (c) higher {PPI} of eyeblink startle and of the P200 and P300 waves. Hypnosis yielded smaller N100 waves to startle stimuli and greater {PPI} of this component than in the waking condition. {sLORETA} analysis revealed that, for the N100 (107 msec) elicited during startle trials, {HHs} had a smaller activation in the left parietal lobe ({BA}2/40) than {LHs}. Auditory pulses of pulsewith prepulse trials in {HHs} yielded less activity of the P300 (280 msec) wave than {LHs}, in the cingulate and posterior cingulate gyrus ({BA}23/31). The present results, on the whole, are in the opposite direction to {PPI} findings on hypnotizability previously reported in the literature. These results provide support to the neuropsychophysiological model that {HHs} have more effective sensory integration and gating (or filtering) of irrelevant stimuli than {LHs}.},

Some authors suggest that mindfulness should be described as a ‘top–down’ emotion regulation strategy, while others suggest that mindfulness should be described as a ‘bottom–up’ emotion regulation strategy. Current discrepancies might derive from the many different descriptions and applications of mindfulness. The present review aims to discuss current descriptions of mindfulness and the relationship existing between mindfulness practice and most commonly investigated emotion regulation strategies. Recent results from functional neuro-imaging studies investigating mindfulness training within the context of emotion regulation are presented. We suggest that mindfulness training is associated with ‘top–down’ emotion regulation in short-term practitioners and with ‘bottom–up’ emotion regulation in long-term practitioners. Limitations of current evidence and suggestions for future research on this topic are discussed.},

The stimuli consisted of a frequent standard tone (500 Hz), an infrequent oddball tone (1000 Hz), and an infrequent distracter (white noise), with all stimuli passively presented through headphones and no task imposed. The strongest meditation compared to control state effects occurred for the distracter stimuli: N1 amplitude from the distracter was reduced frontally during meditation; P2 amplitude from both the distracter and oddball stimuli were somewhat reduced during meditation; P3a amplitude from the distracter was reduced during meditation. The meditation-induced reduction in P3a amplitude was strongest in participants reporting more hours of daily meditation practice and was not evident in participants reporting drowsiness during their experimental meditative session. The ﬁndings suggest that meditation state can decrease the amplitude of neurophysiologic processes that subserve attentional engagement elicited by unexpected and distracting stimuli. Consistent with the aim of Vipassana meditation to reduce cognitive and emotional reactivity, the state effect of reduced P3a amplitude to distracting stimuli reﬂects decreased automated reactivity and evaluative processing of task irrelevant attention-demanding stimuli.},

After the hypnotic induction, but without further suggestions as compared to the baseline condition, all studied parameters of local and remote functional connectivity were signiﬁcantly changed. The signiﬁcant differences between hypnosis and the baseline condition were observable (to different extent) in ﬁve studied independent frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). The results were consistent and stable after 1 year. Based on these ﬁndings we conclude that alteration in functional connectivity of the brain may be regarded as a neuronal correlate of hypnosis (at least in very highly hypnotizable subjects) in which separate cognitive modules and subsystems may be temporarily incapable of communicating with each other normally.},

The amplitude of the N100–P200 complex in both the dual-task and ignore conditions was reduced equally in the attended and unattended ear by the introduction of the primary task. In the dual-task condition, the amplitude of the late Nd but not the early Nd was reduced by a combination of the introduction of the primary task and an increase in its difficulty. P300 showed the same amplitude pattern as the late Nd. We propose that the reduction in N100–P200 amplitude reflects an automatic gating mechanism.

	abstract = {The auditory mismatch negativity ({MMN}) component of event-related potentials ({ERPs}) has served as a neural index of auditory change detection. {MMN} is elicited by presentation of infrequent (deviant) sounds randomly interspersed among frequent (standard) sounds. Deviants elicit a larger negative deﬂection in the {ERP} waveform compared to the standard. There is considerable debate as to whether the neural mechanism of this change detection response is due to release from neural adaptation (neural adaptation hypothesis) or from a prediction error signal (predictive coding hypothesis). Previous studies have not been able to distinguish between these explanations because paradigms typically confound the two. The current study disambiguated effects of stimulus-speciﬁc adaptation from expectation violation using a unique stimulus design that compared expectation violation responses that did and did not involve stimulus change. The expectation violation response without the stimulus change differed in timing, scalp distribution, and attentional modulation from the more typical {MMN} response. There is insufﬁcient evidence from the current study to suggest that the negative deﬂection elicited by the expectation violation alone includes the {MMN}. Thus, we offer a novel hypothesis that the expectation violation response reﬂects a fundamentally different neural substrate than that attributed to the canonical {MMN}.},

	abstract = {Selective attention requires the ability to focus on relevant information and to ignore irrelevant information. The ability to inhibit irrelevant information has been proposed to be the main source of age-related cognitive change (e.g., Hasher \& Zacks, 1988). Although age-related distraction by irrelevant information has been extensively demonstrated in the visual modality, studies involving auditory and cross-modal paradigms have revealed a mixed pattern of results. A comparative evaluation of these paradigms according to sensory modality suggests a twofold trend: Age-related distraction is more likely (a) in unimodal than in cross-modal paradigms and (b) when irrelevant information is presented in the visual modality, rather than in the auditory modality. This distinct pattern of age-related changes in selective attention may be linked to the reliance of the visual and auditory modalities on different filtering mechanisms. Distractors presented through the auditory modality can be filtered at both central and peripheral neurocognitive levels. In contrast, distractors presented through the visual modality are primarily suppressed at more central levels of processing, which may be more vulnerable to aging. We propose the hypothesis that age-related distractibility is modality dependent, a notion that might need to be incorporated in current theories of cognitive aging. Ultimately, this might lead to a more accurate account for the mixed pattern of impaired and preserved selective attention found in advancing age.},

In line with the results of previous studies, discrimination performance deteriorated with increasing magnitude of the task-irrelevant intensity change. However, these distraction effects were dissimilar for intensity increments and decrements: while there were no differences in reaction time ({RT}) between intensity decrements and increments, hit rates ({HR}) were lower for large intensity increments than for large decrements. {ERPs} to taskirrelevant intensity increments and decrements were also distinctly different: the response to intensity increments consisted of an N1 enhancement, mismatch negativity ({MMN}), and P3a, while the response to intensity decrements consisted only of {MMN}. These results are consistent with the assumption that two separate mechanisms (indexed by N1 and {MMN}) underlie auditory change detection. However, the finding that distinct distraction effects were obtained for both intensity decrements and increments but that the P3a is elicited only by the intensity increments seems to suggest that P3a may not be regarded as a general index of attentional shift but rather it is only generated in conditions in which an enhanced N1 is elicited, too.},

Memory was poorer in the high central load (2-back) condition in comparison with the low central load (1-back) condition.

As compared to a no-memory-task condition, memory load enhanced the amplitude of the auditory N1m response. In addition, the N1m amplitude depended on the phase of the memory task, with larger response amplitudes observed during encoding than retention. Further, these amplitude modulations were accompanied by anterior–posterior shifts in N1m source locations. The results show that a memory task for visually presented stimuli alters sensory processing in human auditory cortex, even when subjects are explicitly instructed to ignore any auditory stimuli. Thus, it appears that task demands requiring attentional allocation and short-term memory result in interaction across visual and auditory brain areas carrying out the processing of stimulus features.},

The mismatch negativity ({MMN}) in response to auditory stimuli has been proposed as an objective tool to measure the existence of auditory sensory memory traces. By increasing interstimulus intervals, attenuation of {MMN} peak amplitude and increased {MMN} peak latency have been suggested to reflect duration and decay of sensory memory traces. The aim of the present study is to conduct a systematic review of studies investigating sensory memory duration with {MMN}. Searches of electronic databases yielded 743 articles. Of these, 37 studies met final eligibility criteria. Results point to maturational changes in the time span of auditory sensory memory from birth on with a peak in young adulthood, as well as to a decrease of sensory memory duration in healthy aging. Furthermore, this review suggests that sensory memory decline is related to diverse neurological, psychiatric, and pediatric diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, alcohol abuse, schizophrenia, and language disorders. This review underlines that the {MMN} provides a unique window to the cognitive processes of auditory sensory memory. However, further studies combining electrophysiological and behavioral data, and further studies in clinical populations are needed, also on individual levels, to validate the {MMN} as a clinical tool for the assessment of sensory memory duration.},

	abstract = {Distraction of goal-oriented performance by a sudden change in the auditory environment is an everyday life experience. Different types of changes can be distracting, including a sudden onset of a transient sound and a slight deviation of otherwise regular auditory background stimulation. With regard to deviance detection, it is assumed that slight changes in a continuous sequence of auditory stimuli are detected by a predictive coding mechanisms and it has been demonstrated that this mechanism is capable of distracting ongoing task performance. In contrast, it is open whether transient detection—which does not rely on predictive coding mechanisms—can trigger behavioral distraction, too. In the present study, the effect of rare auditory changes on visual task performance is tested in an auditory-visual cross-modal distraction paradigm. The rare changes are either embedded within a continuous standard stimulation (triggering deviance detection) or are presented within an otherwise silent situation (triggering transient detection). In the event-related brain potentials, deviants elicited the mismatch negativity ({MMN}) while transients elicited an enhanced N1 component, mirroring pre-attentive change detection in both conditions but on the basis of different neuro-cognitive processes. These sensory components are followed by attention related {ERP} components including the P3a and the reorienting negativity ({RON}). This demonstrates that both types of changes trigger switches of attention. Finally, distraction of task performance is observable, too, but the impact of deviants is higher compared to transients. These ﬁndings suggest different routes of distraction allowing for the automatic processing of a wide range of potentially relevant changes in the environment as a pre-requisite for adaptive behavior.},

At the same time, participants were played standard tones which they had to ignore (probability = 0.80), or deviant tones (probability = 0.20) which they had to report. Behavioral results showed that 28.76\% of alarms were not reported in the low cognitive load condition and up to 46.21\% in the high cognitive load condition. On the contrary, perceptual load had no impact on the inattentional deafness rate. Finally, the mean pupil diameter of the ﬁxations that preceded the target tones was signiﬁcantly lower in the trials in which the participants did not report the tones, likely showing a momentary lapse of sustained attention, which in turn was associated to the occurrence of inattentional deafness.},

The cerebral reactivity to a duration deviant in oddball paradigm has been reﬂected as a mismatch negativity ({MMN}).

Magnetoencephalographic ({MEG}) and behavior responses to equi-probable sounds (25e50e75e 100e125 ms or 50e75e100e125e150 ms tones) were recorded in 10 healthy adult volunteers. By subtracting the average of the responses to 4 longer tones from the response to the shortest tone, a clear deﬂection peaking at 100e200 ms from stimulus onset was identiﬁed. This activity was called as substandard {MMNm}, and its amplitude tended to increase with the increment of duration deviance within a stimulation paradigm. The source of sub-standard {MMNm} was localized in superior temporal area, with 5e6 mm more anterior to the generator of N100m response. Behavioral tests also showed best performance in the recognition of the shortest tone than longer tones. In conclusion, the preferential response to the shortest tone in an equiprobable paradigm suggests an asymmetrical processing in the auditory cortex for duration-varying sounds.},

	abstract = {A dominant account of selective attention, perceptual load theory, proposes that when attentional resources are exhausted, task-irrelevant information receives little attention and goes unrecognized. However, the flanker effect—typically used to assay stimulus identification—requires an arbitrary mapping between a stimulus and a response. We looked for failures of flanker identification by using a more-sensitive measure that does not require arbitrary stimulus–response mappings: the correlated flankers effect. We found that flanking items that were task-irrelevant but that correlated with target identity produced a correlated flanker effect. Participants were faster on trials in which the irrelevant flanker had previously correlated with the target than when it did not. Of importance, this correlated flanker effect appeared regardless of perceptual load, occurring even in high-load displays that should have abolished flanker identification. Findings from a standard flanker task replicated the basic perceptual load effect, with flankers not affecting response times under high perceptual load. Our results indicate that task-irrelevant information can be processed to a high level (identification), even under high perceptual load. This challenges a strong account of high perceptual load effects that hypothesizes complete failures of stimulus identification under high perceptual load.},

	abstract = {The extent to which distracting items capture attention despite being irrelevant to the task at hand can be measured either implicitly or explicitly (e.g., Simons, Trends Cogn Sci 4:147–155, 2000). Implicit approaches include the standard attentional capture paradigm in which distraction is measured in terms of reaction time and/or accuracy costs within a focal task in the presence (vs. absence) of a task-irrelevant distractor. Explicit measures include the inattention paradigm in which people are asked directly about their noticing of an unexpected task-irrelevant item. Although the processes of attentional capture have been studied extensively using both approaches in the visual domain, there is much less research on similar processes as they may operate within audition, and the research that does exist in the auditory domain has tended to focus exclusively on either an explicit or an implicit approach. This paper provides an overview of recent research on auditory attentional capture, integrating the key conclusions that may be drawn from both methodological approaches.},

	abstract = {Objective: We investigated event-related brain potentials ({ERPs}) elicited by a novel speech comprehension paradigm modelled after the neuropsychological Token Test. The objective of the study was to determine whether the {ERPs} were sensitive to differences in the initial phonemes of the speech stimuli.
Methods: Twenty-seven healthy subjects identi®ed incorrect spoken sentences on the computerised Token Test ({CTT}). The incorrect spoken sentences contained one word that did not match the previously studied animations. The initial phonemes of these words were either different than or similar to the initial phonemes of their correct counterparts.
Results: Different initial phonemes were associated with an early N2b, while words having similar initial phonemes resulted in a substantially delayed N2b.
Conclusion: The delayed latency effect was due to whether the incorrect word's initial phoneme matched or mismatched that of the expected word. In both cases, this component re¯ected a mismatch with an existing cognitive template maintained in phonological working memory. The results indicate that this mismatching effect re¯ected primarily attentional detection rather than language processing. q 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper reviews the evidence supporting such a functional role and outlines a model of how the attentional system controls the flow of bottom-up auditory information with regard to ongoing-task demands to organize goal-oriented behavior. Specifically, the data obtained in auditory-auditory and auditory-visual distraction paradigms demonstrated that the unexpected occurrence of deviant auditory stimuli or novel sounds captures attention involuntarily, as they distract current task performance. These data indicate that such a process of distraction takes place in three successive stages associated, respectively, to {MMN}, P3a/novelty-P3, and reorienting negativity ({RON}), and that the latter two are modulated by the demands of the task at hand.},

The physiological study of regularity extraction has focused primarily on repetitive sequence-based rules within the sensory environment, or on stimulusoutcome associations in the context of reward-based decision-making. Here we ask whether we implicitly encode nonsequential stochastic regularities, and detect violations therein. We addressed this question using a novel experimental design and both behavioural and magnetoencephalographic ({MEG}) metrics associated with responses to pure-tone sounds with frequencies sampled from a Gaussian distribution. We observed that sounds in the tail of the distribution evoked a larger response than those that fell at the centre. This response resembled the mismatch negativity ({MMN}) evoked by surprising or unlikely events in traditional oddball paradigms. Crucially, responses to physically identical outliers were greater when the distribution was narrower. These results show that humans implicitly keep track of the uncertainty induced by apparently random distributions of sensory events. Source reconstruction suggested that the statistical-contextsensitive responses arose in a temporo-parietal network, areas that have been associated with attention orientation to unexpected events. Our results demonstrate a very early neurophysiological marker of the brain’s ability to implicitly encode complex statistical structure in the environment. We suggest that this sensitivity provides a computational basis for our ability to make perceptual inferences in noisy environments and to make decisions in an uncertain world.},

	abstract = {Using dynamic causal modelling ({DCM}), we have presented provisional evidence to suggest: (i) the mismatch negativity ({MMN}) is generated by self-organised interactions within a hierarchy of cortical sources [Garrido, M.I., Kilner, J.M., Kiebel, S.J., Stephan, K.E., Friston, K.J., 2007. Dynamic causal modelling of evoked potentials: a reproducibility study. {NeuroImage} 36, 571–580] and (ii) the {MMN} rests on plastic change in both extrinsic (between-source) and intrinsic (within source) connections (Garrido et al., under review). In this work we revisit these two key issues in the context of the roving paradigm. Critically, this paradigm allows us to discount any differential response to differences in the stimuli per se, because the standards and oddballs are physically identical. We were able to conﬁrm both the hierarchical nature of the {MMN} generation and the conjoint role of changes in extrinsic and intrinsic connections. These ﬁndings are consistent with a predictive coding account of repetition–suppression and the {MMN}, which gracefully accommodates two important mechanistic perspectives; the model-adjustment hypothesis [Winkler, I., Karmos, G., Näätänen, R., 1996.

Depth recordings have found that sensory stimuli activate primary cortex and then material-speciﬁc encoders.

It is centered in paralimbic and attentional frontoparietocingular cortex, and associated with the P3a. A second system associated with P3b envelopes cognitive contextual integration. It engages the ventral temporofrontal eventencoding cortices (inferotemporal, perirhinal, and ventrolateral prefrontal), association cortices (superior temporal sulcal and posterior parietal), and the hippocampus. Thus, even in simple tasks, activation is widespread but concentrated in particular multilobar systems.

	abstract = {Predictive coding is possibly one of the most inﬂuential, comprehensive, and controversial theories of neural function. While proponents praise its explanatory potential, critics object that key tenets of the theory are untested or even untestable. The present article critically examines existing evidence for predictive coding in the auditory modality. Speciﬁcally, we identify ﬁve key assumptions of the theory and evaluate each in the light of animal, human and modeling studies of auditory pattern processing. For the ﬁrst two assumptions – that neural responses are shaped by expectations and that these expectations are hierarchically organized – animal and human studies provide compelling evidence. The anticipatory, predictive nature of these expectations also enjoys empirical support, especially from studies on unexpected stimulus omission. However, for the existence of separate error and prediction neurons, a key assumption of the theory, evidence is lacking. More work exists on the proposed oscillatory signatures of predictive coding, and on the relation between attention and precision. However, results on these latter two assumptions are mixed or contradictory. Looking to the future, more collaboration between human and animal studies, aided by model-based analyses will be needed to test speciﬁc assumptions and implementations of predictive coding – and, as such, help determine whether this popular grand theory can fulﬁll its expectations.},

It has been previously shown that distraction, as manifested by behavioral response delay, and the P3a and reorienting negativity ({RON}) eventrelated potentials, could be reduced when the forthcoming deviant was signaled by visual cues preceding the sounds. In the present study, we investigated the type of information used in the prevention of distraction by manipulating the information content of the visual cues preceding the sounds. Cues could signal the specific variant of the forthcoming deviant, or they could just signal that the next tone was a deviant. We found that stimulus-specific cue information was used in reducing distraction. The results also suggest that early P3a and {RON} index processes related to the specific deviating stimulus feature, whereas late P3a reflects a general distraction-related process.},

Results indicated that the processes indexed by the above-mentioned {ERPs} are not strongly coupled.

This task was performed in the presence of a series of irrelevant auditory probes which the radar operators were instructed to ignore. Prior to performing the radar-monitoring task the subjects performed a block of auditory detection trials in which they were asked to respond to the occurrence of one of two low probability tones and ignore the other low probability tone along with a higher probability standard tone. {ERPs} were recorded from the occurrence of the tones in both the baseline and low and high workload radar-monitoring conditions. The amplitude of the {NlOO}, N200, and early and late mismatch negativity ({MMN}) components decreased from the baseline to the low load radar-monitoring task and again with an increase in the difftculty of the radar-monitoring task.

Study 1 documents a confound that renders important portions of previous research difficult to interpret. In Studies 2 and 3, race categorization was stronger than categorization by more weakly accessible categories when situational support in terms of topic relevance was comparable across categories. A situational focus on race further increased race categorization. Race categorization was reduced in the presence of strongly cued cross-cutting coalitions. Race categorization also was depressed when situational factors promoted comparative processing of cross-cutting categories while cues to potential coalitional divisions were held constant (Study 4). Accessibility, topic relevance, and cuing cross-cutting coalitions had the same effects on gender categorization as found for race categorization (Study 5).

Here, we describe how people categorize others into both perceptually obvious and perceptually ambiguous social groups from their faces, discussing potential mechanisms that may underlie categorization accuracy and noting some of the social consequences that result from categorizing other people into groups.},

Within academia, it has a particularly reflexive relationship with the human sciences in which sexual harassment can be both an object of research and a problematic behavior amongst those engaged in that research. This paper offers a partial history in which these two are brought together as a common object of social psychology’s culture of sexual harassment. Here we follow Haraway in using culture to capture the sense-making that psychologists do through and to the side of their formal knowledge production practices. Our history is multi-sited and draws together (1) the use of sexual harassment as an experimental technique, (2) feminist activism and research which made sexual harassment an object of knowledge in social psychology, and (3) oral history accounts of sexual harassment amongst social psychologists. By reading these contexts against each other, we provide a thick description of how sexual harassment initiates women and men into cultures of control in experimental social psychology and highlight the ethical-epistemological dilemma inherent in disciplinary practices.},

	abstract = {Categorical perception ({CP}) is the phenomenon by which the categories possessed by an observer influences the observers' perception. Experimentally, {CP} is revealed when an observer's ability to make perceptual discriminations between things is better when those things belong to different categories rather than the same category, controlling for the physical difference between the things. We consider several core questions related to {CP}: Is it caused by innate and/or learned categories, how early in the information processing stream do categories influence perception, and what is the relation between ongoing linguistic processing and {CP}? {CP} for both speech and visual entities are surveyed, as are computational and mathematical models of {CP}. {CP} is an important phenomenon in cognitive science because it represents an essential adaptation of perception to support categorizations that an organism needs to make. Sensory signals that could be linearly related to physical qualities are warped in a nonlinear manner, transforming analog inputs into quasi-digital, quasi-symbolic encodings.

Race-contingent aftereffects reﬂect perceptions of typicality, indicating a gradual transition of activity across channels as faces change from looking more typical of one race to the other We examine whether faces forming more discrete categories (sex: male/ female; species: human/monkey) are encoded in a similar fashion, or whether they are instead encoded via more dichotomous categorical judgements. Curves representing the rate of change of aftereffect magnitude as stimuli changed from male to female produced shallow slopes, closely resembling ratings of typicality, but differing signiﬁcantly from slopes for categorical judgements. For species, aftereffect slopes were signiﬁcantly shallower than both ratings of typicality and categorical judgements. Overall, these results suggest that the encoding of facial properties such as these is not categorical, but instead involves a graded response as stimulus typicality varies. Aftereffect slopes were similar across the two experiments, raising the possibility of a common system that is recruited during contingent adaptation, regardless of the speciﬁc dimension involved or the categories used by the experimenter.},

These dimensions comprise (1) the speciﬁcity of adapting face information, e.g., identity, gender, or age aspects of the material to be adapted to (2) aspects of timing (e.g., the sustainability of adaptation effects) and (3) transfer relations between face images presented during adaptation and adaptation tests (e.g., images of the same or different identities).

	abstract = {Priming ({PR}) and adaptation-related aftereffects ({AEs}) are two phenomena when recent perceptual experiences alter face perception. While {AEs} are often reﬂected in contrastive perceptual biases, {PR} typically leads to behavioural facilitation. Previous research suggests that both phenomena modulate broadly similar components of the event-related potentials ({ERPs}). To disentangle the underlying neural mechanisms of {PR} and {AE}, we induced both effects within the same subjects and paradigm. We presented pairs of stimuli, where the ﬁrst (S1) was a famous face (identity A, B or C), a morph between two famous faces (50/50\% A/B), or a Fourier phase randomized face (as a control stimulus matched for lowlevel visual information) and the second (S2) was a face drawn from morph continua between identity A and B. Participants’ performance in matching S2s to either A or B revealed contrastive aftereffects for ambiguous S2 faces, which were more likely perceived as identity B following the presentation of A and vice versa. Unambiguous S2 faces, however, showed {PR}, with signiﬁcantly shorter response times, as well as higher classiﬁcation performance, for identity-congruent than for incongruent S1eS2 pairs. Analyses of the simultaneously recorded {ERPs} revealed clear categorical adaptation at around 155e205 msec post-stimulus onset. We also found amplitude modulations for unambiguous S2 faces following identity-congruent S1 faces, related to {PR}, starting at 90 msec and being the most pronounced at around 205e255 msec. For ambiguous S2 faces, we also observed an {ERP} effect at around 205e255 msec that was correlated with behavioural {AEs}. Our results show that face {PR} and {AEs} are present simultaneously within a single paradigm, depending on the ambiguity of S2 faces and/or on the similarity of S1 and S2, and suggest that exclusive mechanisms might underlie both {PR} and {AEs} and that objectcategory and identity processing might run in parallel during face processing.},

Here we investigated whether adaptation can enhance identiﬁcation performance for faces from an adapted, relative to an unadapted, population. Five minutes of adaptation to an average Asian or Caucasian face reduced identiﬁcation thresholds for faces from the adapted relative to the unadapted race. We replicated this interaction in two studies, using different participants, faces and adapting procedures. These results suggest that adaptation has a functional role in high-level, as well as low-level, visual processing. We suggest that adaptation to the average of a population may reduce responses to common properties shared by all members of the population, effectively orthogonalizing identity vectors in a multi-dimensional face space and freeing neural resources to code distinctive properties, which are useful for identiﬁcation.},

Consequently, exposure to faces biases perceptions of subsequently viewed faces such that faces similar to those recently seen are perceived as more normal. Simultaneously inducing such aftereffects in opposite directions for two groups of faces indicates somewhat discrete representations for those groups. Here we examine how labelling inﬂuences the perception of category in faces differing in colour. We show category-contingent aftereffects following exposure to faces differing in eye spacing (wide versus narrow) for blue versus red faces when such groups are consistently labelled with socially meaningful labels (Extravert versus Introvert; Soldier versus Builder). Category-contingent aftereffects were not seen using identical methodology when labels were not meaningful or were absent. These data suggest that human representations of faces can be rapidly tuned to code for meaningful social categories and that such tuning requires both a label and an associated visual difference. Results highlight the ﬂexibility of the cognitive visual system to discriminate categories even in adulthood.},

Here we investigated whether adaptation can enhance identiﬁcation performance for faces from an adapted, relative to an unadapted, population. Five minutes of adaptation to an average Asian or Caucasian face reduced identiﬁcation thresholds for faces from the adapted relative to the unadapted race. We replicated this interaction in two studies, using different participants, faces and adapting procedures. These results suggest that adaptation has a functional role in high-level, as well as low-level, visual processing. We suggest that adaptation to the average of a population may reduce responses to common properties shared by all members of the population, effectively orthogonalizing identity vectors in a multi-dimensional face space and freeing neural resources to code distinctive properties, which are useful for identiﬁcation.},

Fifty-seven (20 Black, 37 White) participants completed measures of explicit racism, implicit racism, collective self-esteem ({CSE}), and racial centrality. Category boundaries between Black and White faces were measured in three separate conditions: following adaptation to (1) a neutral gray background, a sequence of (2) Black or (3) White faces. Two additional conditions measured category boundaries for facial distortion to investigate whether attitudes relate to mechanisms of racial identity alone, or to more global mechanisms of face perception. Using a two-alternative forced-choice staircase procedure, participants indicated whether a test image appeared to be Black or White (or contracted or expanded). Following neutral adaptation, participants with higher {CSE} showed category boundaries shifted toward faces with a higher percentage of Black features. In addition, the strength of short-term sensitivity shifts following adaptation to Black and White faces was related to explicit and implicit attitudes about race. Sensitivity shifts were weaker when participants scored higher on explicit racism, but were stronger when participants scored higher on implicit but lower on explicit racism. The results of this study indicate that attitudes about race account for some individual differences in natural category boundaries between races as well as the strength of identity aftereffects following face adaptation.},

	abstract = {In two experiments, participants were presented with a triad of morphed White and Hispanic faces paired with pseudoword labels. The meanings of these labels were manipulated to represent categorical information about the face. Labels were said to represent either the person’s belief, the food s/he ate, the disease s/he had, or the person’s last name. The results indicated that categorical information affects our judgments of faces. Information categories such as belief, food, and diseases were particularly strong in modifying the participants’ similarity judgment of faces, whereas information characterized with last names of faces were least powerful. Previous research focuses on race face perception being affected primarily by racial indicators or racial information. Our results provide that how we perceptually analyze faces is not confined to obvious racial cues, but by non-racial semantic information as well, suggesting that category-relevant information by itself provides a strong basis for inductive generalization.},

Participants were socially included or excluded via Cyberball (a virtual ball-tossing task). In Experiment 1, ostracized participants showed greater perceptual acuity in distinguishing between subtly happy and angry expressions combined with a reduced ability to discriminate expressions within each expression category. Experiment 2 found analogous categorical perception effects for targets varying on the dimension of race. Importantly, this effect was speciﬁc to social information; categorical perception of nonsocial objects was not qualiﬁed by social exclusion. These results suggest that ostracism exacerbates categorical perception, attuning perceivers to the differences between various inclusion- and exclusionrelated categories relative to within category acuity, making the world appear more ‘black-and-white’ than it might otherwise.},

First, I discuss the constraints in the number of identities that researchers are able to test in an empirical study, and highlight relevant decision rules. Second, I discuss when to focus on “master” identities (e.g., gender) versus “emergent” identities (i.e., White lesbian). Third, I argue that treating identity as a process situated within social structural contexts facilitates the research process.

While revealing, this work has overlooked the fact that, prior to the application of categorical thinking as an economizing mental tool, perceivers must first extract category-triggering information from available stimulus cues. It is possible, therefore, that basic perceptual processes may also contribute to people’s propensity to view others in a category-based manner. This possibility was explored in 3 experiments in which the authors investigated the ease with which perceivers can extract categorical and identity-based knowledge from faces under both optimal and suboptimal (i.e., inverted faces, blurred faces, rapidly presented faces) processing conditions. The results confirmed that categorical knowledge is extracted from faces more efficiently than identity-related knowledge, a finding that underscores the importance of perceptual operations in the generation of categorical thinking.},

	abstract = {Facial markers of body composition are frequently studied in evolutionary psychology and are important in computational and forensic face recognition. We assessed the association of body mass index ({BMI}) and waist-to-hip ratio ({WHR}) with facial shape and texture (color pattern) in a sample of young Middle European women by a combination of geometric morphometrics and image analysis. Faces of women with high {BMI} had a wider and rounder facial outline relative to the size of the eyes and lips, and relatively lower eyebrows. Furthermore, women with high {BMI} had a brighter and more reddish skin color than women with lower {BMI}. The same facial features were associated with {WHR}, even though {BMI} and {WHR} were only moderately correlated. Yet {BMI} was better predictable than {WHR} from facial attributes. After leave-one-out cross-validation, we were able to predict 25\% of variation in {BMI} and 10\% of variation in {WHR} by facial shape. Facial texture predicted only about 3–10\% of variation in {BMI} and {WHR}. This indicates that facial shape primarily reflects total fat proportion, rather than the distribution of fat within the body. The association of reddish facial texture in high-{BMI} women may be mediated by increased blood pressure and superficial blood flow as well as diet. Our study elucidates how geometric morphometric image analysis serves to quantify the effect of biological factors such as {BMI} and {WHR} to facial shape and color, which in turn contributes to social perception.},

This perceptual adaptation aftereffect occurs not only for simple stimulus features but also for high-level stimulus properties (e.g., faces’ gender, identity and emotional expressions). Recent studies on aftereffects demonstrate that adaptation to human bodies can modulate face perception because these stimuli share common properties. Those ﬁndings suggest that the aftereffect is not related to the physical property of the stimulus but to the great number of semantic attributes shared by the adapter and the test. Here, we report a novel cross-category adaptation paradigm with both silhouette face proﬁles (Experiment 1.1) and frontal view faces (Experiment 2) as adapters, testing the aftereffects when viewing an androgynous test body. The results indicate that adaptation to both silhouette face proﬁles and frontal view faces produces gender aftereffects (e.g., after visual exposure to a female face, the androgynous body appears as more male and vice versa). These ﬁndings conﬁrm that high-level perceptual aftereffects can occur between cross-categorical stimuli that share common properties.},

Judgements of facial trustworthiness can also be inﬂuenced by visual adaptation; to date these (un)trustworthy face aftereffects have only been shown following adaptation to emotional expression and facial masculinity/femininity. In this study we assessed how exposure to trustworthy and untrustworthy faces inﬂuenced the perception of the trustworthiness of subsequent test faces. In a mixed factorial design experiment, we tested the inﬂuence of adaptation to female and male faces on the perception of subsequent female and male faces in both female and male observers. In female observers, we found that following adaptation to trustworthy and untrustworthy faces subsequent test faces appeared less like the adapting stimuli. Sex of the adapting and test faces did not have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on these (un)trustworthy face aftereffects. In male observers, however, we found no signiﬁcant inﬂuence of the effect of adaptation on the subsequent perception of face trustworthiness. The clear difference in the visual aftereffects induced in female and male observers indicates the operation of different mechanisms underlying the perception of facial trustworthiness, and future studies should investigate these mechanisms separately in female and male observers.},

Here we show that they are also linked to individual differences in adaptive coding of face identity, measured using face identity aftereffects. Identity aftereffects correlated significantly with several measures of face-selective recognition ability. They also correlated marginally with own-race face recognition ability, suggesting a role for adaptive coding in the well-known other-race effect. More generally, these results highlight the important functional role of adaptive face-coding mechanisms in face expertise, taking us beyond the traditional focus on holistic coding mechanisms.},

Reduced adaptive coding of face identity has been proposed as a neurocognitive endophenotype for autism, because it is found in autism and in relatives of individuals with autism. Autistic traits can also extend continuously into the general population, raising the possibility that reduced adaptive coding of face identity may be more generally associated with autistic traits. In the present study, we investigated whether adaptive coding of face identity decreases as autistic traits increase in an undergraduate population. Adaptive coding was measured using face identity aftereffects, and autistic traits were measured using the Autism-Spectrum Quotient ({AQ}) and its subscales. We also measured face and car recognition ability to determine whether autistic traits are selectively related to face recognition difﬁculties. We found that men who scored higher on levels of autistic traits related to social interaction had reduced adaptive coding of face identity. This result is consistent with the idea that atypical adaptive face-coding mechanisms are an endophenotype for autism. Autistic traits were also linked with faceselective recognition difﬁculties in men. However, there were some unexpected sex differences. In women, autistic traits were linked positively, rather than negatively, with adaptive coding of identity, and were unrelated to face-selective recognition difﬁculties. These sex differences indicate that autistic traits can have different neurocognitive correlates in men and women and raise the intriguing possibility that endophenotypes of autism can differ in males and females.},

That is, “if it adapts, it’s there.” Many insights about vision have come from this use of adaptation, as a method. A second important trend has been the realization that the processes of adaptation are themselves essential to how vision works and thus likely operate at all levels. That is, “if it’s there, it adapts.” This observation has focused interest on the mechanisms of adaptation as the target rather than the probe. Together, these approaches have led to an emerging view of adaptation as a fundamental and ubiquitous coding strategy impacting all aspects of how we see.},

	abstract = {Carter, Kofler, Forster, \& {McCullough} (2015) conducted a bias-corrected meta-analysis of the so-called ego depletion effect to determine its real size and robustness. Their efforts have raised awareness of how badly meta-analyses can mislead when the articles that go into them are products of publication bias. Despite our genuine enthusiasm for their work, we worry that in their zeal to correct the record of publication bias, they have drawn too heavily on largely untested statistical techniques that can be insensitive and sometimes misleading. We tested a set of bias-correction techniques, including those favored by Carter and colleagues, by simulating 40,000 meta-analyses in a range of situations that approximate what is found in the ego depletion literature, most notably the presence of heterogeneous effects filtered by publication bias. Our simulations revealed that not one of the bias-correction techniques revealed itself superior in all conditions, with corrections performing adequately in some situations but inadequately in others. Such a result implies that meta-analysts ought to present a range of possible effect sizes and to consider them all as being possible. The problem with the ego depletion literature is that the biascorrected estimates for the overall effect do not converge, with estimates ranging from g=0 to g=0.24 to g=0.26. Despite our admiration for this program of meta-research, we suggest that bias-corrected meta-analyses cannot yet resolve whether the overall ego depletion is different from zero or not.},

The paper starts with a brief outline of the conceptual framework underlying the relationship between P3 amplitude and task demands, and the cognitive task manipulations that determine demands on capacity. P3 amplitude results are then discussed on the basis of an extensive review of the relevant literature. It is concluded that although it has often been assumed that P3 amplitude depends on the capacity for processing task relevant stimuli, the utility of P3 amplitude as a sensitive and diagnostic measure of processing capacity remains limited. The major factor that prompts this conclusion is that the two principal task variables that have been used to manipulate capacity allocation, namely task difficulty and task emphasis, have opposite effects on the amplitude of P3. I suggest that this is because, in many tasks, an increase in difficulty transforms the structure or actual content of the flow of information in the processing systems, thereby interfering with the very processes that underlie P3 generation. Finally, in an attempt to theoretically integrate the results of the reviewed studies, it is proposed that P3 amplitude reflects activation of elements in a eventcategorization network that is controlled by the joint operation of attention and working memory.},

First, to extend previous findings of P300 load modulation to {WM} for faces. Second, to examine whether N170 and N250r are also influenced by {WM} load. Between one and four unfamiliar faces were simultaneously presented for memory encoding. After a one second delay, a target face appeared, and participants had to judge whether this face was part of the previous face array. P300 amplitude decreased as {WM} load increased, and this P300 suppression was observed at both encoding and retrieval. {WM} load was also found to modulate other {ERPs}. The amplitude of the N170 elicited by the target face decreased with load, and this N170 decrease levelled off at load two, reflecting the behavioural {WM} capacity of around two faces. In addition, the N250r, observed as an {ERP} difference for target faces that were present in the encoding array relative to target faces that were absent, was also reduced for higher {WM} loads. These findings extend previous work by showing that P300 modulation by {WM} load also occurs for faces. Furthermore, we show, for the first time, that {WM} load affects the N250r and the early visual N170 component. This suggests that higher visual areas play an important role in {WM} for faces.},

Methods: Subjects had to memorize one (load1) or 3 (load3) letters (memory set) and search for these among a recognition set consisting of 4 letters only if the letters appeared in the correct (relevant) color. Event-related potentials ({ERPs}) as well as alpha and theta event-related synchronization and desynchronization ({ERD}/{ERS}) were derived from the {EEG} that was recorded during the task.
Results: In the {ERP} to the memory set, a prolonged load-related positivity was found. In response to the recognition set, effects of relevance were manifested in an early frontal positivity and a later frontal negativity. Effects of load were found in a search-related negativity within the attended category and a suppression of the P3-amplitude. Theta {ERS} was most pronounced for the most difﬁcult task condition during the recognition set, whereas alpha {ERD} showed a load-effect only during memorization.
Conclusions: The manipulation of stimulus relevance and memory load affected both {ERP} components and {ERD}/{ERS}.

The present study aims to meet the apparent need for an empirically validated abridged {NFC} scale. Based on data obtained from an aggregated heterogeneous sample (N = 1584), we propose a 15-item selection comprising three items from each facet scale. Comparison of the full and reduced {NFC} scales revealed similar psychometric properties and correlations with third variables. The brief {NFC} scale provides researchers with a useful tool for assessing the {NFC} construct when practical considerations prohibit the use of the original full 42-item scale or the 41-item revised version.},

	shorttitle = {Gender Trouble in Social Psychology},
	abstract = {A quarter of a century ago, philosopher Judith Butler (1990) called upon society to create “gender trouble” by disrupting the binary view of sex, gender, and sexuality. She argued that gender, rather than being an essential quality following from biological sex, or an inherent identity, is an act which grows out of, reinforces, and is reinforced by, societal norms and creates the illusion of binary sex. Despite the fact that Butler’s philosophical approach to understanding gender has many resonances with a large body of gender research being conducted by social psychologists, little theorizing and research within experimental social psychology has drawn directly on Butler’s ideas. In this paper, we will discuss how Butler’s ideas can add to experimental social psychologists’ understanding of gender. We describe the Butler’s ideas from Gender Trouble and discuss the ways in which they ﬁt with current conceptualizations of gender in experimental social psychology. We then propose a series of new research questions that arise from this integration of Butler’s work and the social psychological literature. Finally, we suggest a number of concrete ways in which experimental social psychologists can incorporate notions of gender performativity and gender trouble into the ways in which they research gender.},

The present auditory–visual oddball study examines the effect of the informational content of a sound on the performance in a visual discrimination task. The informational content was modulated by varying the sound–target interval and the probability of target occurrence. Effects of informational content were examined with two types of distractors: a burst of white noise (deviant) and environmental sounds (novel). Behavioral results reveal the following. (1) Novel and deviant sounds do not necessarily cause behavioral distraction effects when they are uninformative with respect to both time and probability of occurrence of a visual target. (2) Novel, but not deviant, sounds cause an unspecific bias toward facilitation. (3) The informational content of task-irrelevant sounds speeds reaction times, indicating the use of information not directly related to the task for enhancing performance. (4) It is suggested that performance in deviant and novel trials is the sum of the costs of attentional orienting and benefits of information as well as benefits of unspecific activation for novels.},

However, under certain circumstances novel stimuli can also elicit a general alerting response having beneﬁcial effects on performance. In a series of experiments we investigated whether different aspects of novelty – stimulus novelty, contextual novelty, surprise, deviance, and relative complexity – lead to distraction or facilitation. We used a version of the visual oddball paradigm in which participants responded to an occasional auditory target. Participants responded faster to this auditory target when it occurred during the presentation of novel visual stimuli than of standard stimuli, especially at {SOAs} of 0 and 200 ms (Experiment 1). Facilitation was absent for both infrequent simple deviants and frequent complex images (Experiment 2). However, repeated complex deviant images did facilitate responses to the auditory target at the 200 ms {SOA} (Experiment 3). These ﬁndings suggest that task-irrelevant deviant visual stimuli can facilitate responses to an unrelated auditory target in a short 0–200 millisecond time-window after presentation. This only occurs when the deviant stimuli are complex relative to standard stimuli. We link our ﬁndings to the novelty P3, which is generated under the same circumstances, and to the adaptive gain theory of the locus coeruleus–norepinephrine system (Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005), which may explain the timing of the effects.},

The primary task was to discriminate laterally and centrally presented tones; these stimuli were composed of a frequent standard or an infrequent deviant pitch. In the distraction condition, pitch was irrelevant and could be ignored. In the switch condition, pitch changes were relevant: whenever a deviant tone was presented, participants had to discriminate its pitch and not its direction. The task in standard trials remained unchanged. In both conditions, deviants elicited mismatch negativity ({MMN}), P3a, P3b, and reorienting negativity ({RON}). We, therefore, suggest that distraction and switching are triggered by the same system of attentional control. In addition, remarkable differences were observable between the two conditions: In the switch condition the {MMN} was followed by a more pronounced N2b and P3a. The differences between these components support the idea that in the distraction condition, a switch of attention is only initiated but not completely performed.},

In half of the trials, a second stimulus occurred after a variable, adaptively adjusted delay, indicating to abandon the ﬁrst response, and only respond to the second stimulus using another set of left and right response keys. In Experiment 1, different tasks had to be performed with the ﬁrst and second stimulus (task-switch condition); in Experiment 2, the same task had to be performed with both stimuli (task-repetition condition).

One hundred and twenty-eight old and 130 young adults performed a serial recall task while ignoring (1) steady state sequences in which the same distractor word was repeated twelve times, (2) auditory deviant sequences in which the ninth distractor word deviated from the otherwise repetitive context, and (3) changing state sequences in which twelve different distractor words were presented. According to inhibitory deficit theory, older adults should generally be more susceptible to auditory distraction. The duplex-mechanism account of auditory distraction is based on the idea that the changing state effect and the auditory deviant effect are functionally different. It suggests that older adults should be more impaired by auditory deviants than younger adults, but equally able to ignore changing state sequences. The age-invariant distractibility account predicts no age differences in auditory distraction, which was confirmed by the present results. Old adults performed worse than young adults in the serial recall task. In both age groups, however, the changing state effect (i.e., increased disruption by changing state sequences relative to steady state sequences) and the auditory deviant effect (i.e., increased disruption by auditory deviant sequences relative to steady state sequences) were equivalent. These effects were also unrelated to individual differences in working memory capacity.},

We compared the performance of older and younger participants on a well-characterized auditory–visual distraction task. Based on the dissociations observed in aging between attentional processes sustained by the anterior and posterior attentional networks, our prediction was that distraction by irrelevant novel sounds would be stronger in older adults than in young adults while both groups would be equally able to use sound as an alert to prepare for upcoming stimuli. The results conﬁrmed both predictions: there was a larger distraction effect in the older participants, but the alert effect was equivalent in both groups.

The disruption by a sequence of changing auditory distractors (the changing-state effect) is attributed to the obligatory processing of the to-be-ignored information, which automatically interferes with short-term memory. The disruption by a sequence with a single deviant auditory distractor (the deviation effect), in contrast, is attributed to attentional capture. This account predicts that working memory capacity ({WMC}) is differentially related to the changing-state effect and to the deviation effect: The changing-state effect is assumed to be immune to cognitive control and, thus, to be unrelated to {WMC}. The deviation effect, in contrast, is assumed to be open to cognitive control and, thus, to be negatively related to {WMC}. Despite several methodological improvements over previous studies (large sample sizes, a composite measure of {WMC}, and a direct statistical comparison of the correlations), there was no evidence of a dissociation between the changing-state effect and the deviation effect. {WMC} was unrelated both to the size of the changing-state effect and to the size of the deviation effect, irrespective of whether simple stimuli (letters, Experiments 1 and 3) or complex stimuli (words and sentences, Experiment 2) were used as auditory distractors. Furthermore, a cross-experimental analysis with a total sample of N = 601 participants disconﬁrmed the idea that both types of auditory distraction show a differential relationship with {WMC}. Implications for models of auditory distraction are discussed.},

According to the embedded-processes model, both types of distractors should interfere with the encoding and rehearsal of targets in the focus of attention. According to the duplex-mechanism account, changing-state distractors should interfere only with rehearsal, whereas deviant distractors should interfere only with encoding. Inconsistent with the latter view, changingstate and deviant distractor sounds interfered with both the encoding and the retention of the targets. Both types of auditory distraction were most pronounced during the second half of encoding when the increasing rehearsal demands had to be coordinated with the continuous updating of the rehearsal set.

	abstract = {Deviant as well as changing auditory distractors interfere with short-term memory. According to the duplex model of auditory distraction, the deviation effect is caused by a shift of attention while the changing-state effect is due to obligatory order processing. This theory predicts that foreknowledge should reduce the deviation effect, but should have no effect on the changing-state effect. We compared the effect of foreknowledge on the two phenomena directly within the same experiment. In a pilot study, specific foreknowledge was impotent in reducing either the changing-state effect or the deviation effect, but reduced disruption by sentential speech, suggesting that the effects of foreknowledge on auditory distraction may increase with the complexity of the stimulus material. Given the unexpected nature of this finding, we tested whether the same finding would be obtained in (a) a direct preregistered replication in Germany and (b) an additional replication with translated stimulus materials in Sweden.},

	abstract = {The P3a is an event-related potential comprising an early fronto-central phase and a late frontoparietal phase. It is observed after novel events and has classically been considered to reflect the attention processing of distracting stimuli. However, novel sounds can lead to behavioral facilitation as much as behavioral distraction. This illustrates the duality of the orienting response which includes both an attentional and an arousal component. Using a paradigm with visual or auditory targets to detect and irrelevant unexpected distracting sounds to ignore, we showed that the facilitation effect by distracting sounds is independent of the target modality and endures more than 1500 ms. These results confirm that the behavioral facilitation observed after distracting sounds is related to an increase in unspecific phasic arousal on top of the attentional capture. Moreover, the amplitude of the early phase of the P3a to distracting sounds positively correlated with subjective arousal ratings, contrary to other event-related potentials. We propose that the fronto-central early phase of the P3a would index the arousing properties of distracting sounds and would be linked to the arousal component of the orienting response. Finally, we discuss the relevance of the P3a as a marker of distraction.},

Although evidence of habituation has emerged after a passive listening phase, previous attempts to observe habituation to to-be ignored distractors on a trial-by-trial basis have proven to be fruitless. With the present study, we suggest that habituation to auditory distractors occurs, but has often been overlooked because past attempts to measure habituation in the irrelevant-sound paradigm were not sensitive enough. In a series of four experiments, the disruptive effects of to-beignored speech and music relative to a quiet control condition were markedly reduced after eight repetitions, regardless of whether trials were presented in blocks (Exp. 1) or in a random order (Exp. 2). The auditory distractor’s playback direction (forward, backward) had no effect (Exp. 3). The same results were obtained when the auditory distractors were only presented in a retention interval after the presentation of the to-be-remembered items (Exp. 4). This pattern is only consistent with theoretical accounts that allow for attentional processes to interfere with the maintenance of information in working memory.},

We analyzed evoked and induced activity related to the memory items as well as spectral activity during the retention phase. The main ﬁnding is that the behavioral sound effect was exclusively reﬂected by attenuated token-induced gamma activation most pronounced between 50–60 Hz and 50–100 ms post-stimulus onset.

This adaptation effect has been documented for general conﬁgural effects, as well as for the facial properties of gender, ethnicity, expression, and identity. We began by replicating the ﬁnding that adaptation to ethnicity, gender, and a combination of both features induces selective shifts in category appearance. We then investigated whether this adaptation has perceptual consequences beyond a shift in the perceived category boundary by measuring the effects of adaptation on {RSVP}, spatial search, and discrimination tasks.

In four experiments we examined the relative contribution of local auditory changes on the one hand and expectation violations on the other hand in the disruption of serial recall by irrelevant sound. We present evidence for a greater disruption by auditory sequences ending in unexpected steady state distractor repetitions compared to auditory sequences with expected changing state endings even though the former contained fewer local changes. This effect was demonstrated with piano melodies (Experiment 1) and speech distractors (Experiment 2). Furthermore, it was replicated when the expectation violation occurred after the encoding of the target items (Experiment 3), indicating that the items’ maintenance in short-term memory was disrupted by attentional capture and not their encoding. This seems to be primarily due to the violation of a model of the specific auditory distractor sequences because the effect vanishes and even reverses when the experiment provides no opportunity to build up a specific neural model about the distractor sequence (Experiment 4). Nevertheless, the violation of abstract long-term knowledge about auditory regularities seems to cause a small and transient capture effect: Disruption decreased markedly over the course of the experiments indicating that participants habituated to the unexpected distractor repetitions across trials. The overall pattern of results adds to the growing literature that the degree to which auditory distractors violate situation-specific expectations is a more important determinant of auditory distraction than the degree to which a distractor sequence contains local auditory changes.},

	abstract = {The mismatch negativity ({MMN}) has been widely studied with oddball tasks to index processing of unexpected auditory change. The {MMN} is computed as the difference of deviant minus standard and is used to capture the pattern violation by the deviant. However, this oddball {MMN} is confounded because the deviant differs physically from the standard and is presented less often. To improve measurement, the same tone as the deviant is presented in a separate condition. This control tone is equiprobable with other tones and is used to compute a corrected {MMN} (deviant minus control). Typically, the tones are in random order except that consecutive tones are not identical (no‐repetition rule). In contrast, a recent study on frequency {MMN} presented tones in a regular up‐and‐down sequence (cascade rule). If the cascade rule is detected more easily than the no‐repetition rule, there should be a lower risk of a confounding {MMN} within the cascade condition. However, in previous research, the cascade and no‐repetition conditions differed not only in the regularity of the tone sequence but also in number of tones, frequency range, and proportion of tones. We controlled for these differences to isolate effects of regularity in the tone sequence. Results of our preregistered analyses provided moderate evidence ({BF}01{\textgreater}6) that the corrected {MMN} did not differ between cascade and no‐repetition conditions. These findings imply that no‐repetition and cascade rules are processed similarly and that the no‐repetition condition provides an adequate control in frequency {MMN}.},

Relative to non-face objects and alphabetical scripts, Chinese characters provide a good contrast to faces because of their structural configuration, requirement for high level of visual expertise to literate Chinese people, and unique appearance and identity for each individual stimulus. To examine potential categorical differences in their neural processing, event-related potentials ({ERPs}) were recorded to blocked face and Chinese character stimuli. Fast adaptation method was applied to better control for the low-level stimulus difference between faces and Chinese characters. Participants were required to respond to the color of the outer frame in which these stimuli were presented, at either a fast ({ISI} 650 ms) or slow ({ISI} 1300 ms) rate, and with an orientation that was either the same or alternated between upright and inverted. Faces elicited a larger and later N170 relative to characters, but the N170 was more left-lateralized for characters relative to the faces. Adaptation-by-rate and adaptation-by-orientation effects were observed on the amplitude of N170, and both were more pronounced for faces relative to characters. Inverted stimuli elicited a later N170 relative to upright stimuli, without amplitude change, and this inversion effect was more pronounced for faces relative to characters. Moreover, faces elicited a larger and later P1 and a larger adaptation-by-rate effect on P1 relative to characters. The adaptation-by-orientation effect was illustrated by a larger P1 under the same relative to the alternated orientation condition. Therefore, evidence from the amplitude and the lateralization of N170, the stimulus inversion effect on N170 latency, and the neural adaptation between faces and Chinese characters on P1 and N170 components support the notion that the processing of faces and Chinese characters involve categorically different neural mechanisms.},

We investigated the role of the perceptual mechanism reﬂected by the N170 effect by comparing the adaptation of the N170 amplitude when target faces were preceded either by identical face images or by different faces relative to when they were preceded by objects. In two experiments, we demonstrate that the N170 is equally adapted by repetition of the same or different faces. Thus, our ﬁndings show that the N170 is sensitive to the category rather than the identity of a face. This outcome supports the hypothesis that the N170 effect reﬂects the activity of a perceptual mechanism which discriminates faces from objects and streams face stimuli to dedicated circuits, specialized in encoding and decoding information about the face.},

Instead, there appear to be functionally relevant interactions that occur. In the present article, we describe research examining how cues conveyed by the human face, voice, and body interact to form the uniﬁed representations that guide our perceptions of and responses to other people. We explain how these information sources are often thrown into interaction through bottom-up forces (e.g., phenotypic cues) as well as top-down forces (e.g., stereotypes and prior knowledge). Such interactions point to a person perception process that is driven by an intimate interface between bottom-up perceptual and top-down social processes. Incorporating data from neuroimaging, event-related potentials ({ERP}), computational modeling, computer mouse-tracking, and other behavioral measures, we discuss the structure of this interface, and we consider its implications and adaptive purposes. We argue that an increased understanding of person perception will likely require a synthesis of insights and techniques, from social psychology to the cognitive, neural, and vision sciences.},

	abstract = {How fast are visual stimuli categorized as faces by the human brain? Because of their high temporal resolution and the possibility to record simultaneously from the whole brain, electromagnetic scalp measurements should be the ideal method to clarify this issue. However, this question remains debated, with studies reporting face-sensitive responses varying from 50 ms to 200 ms following stimulus onset. Here we disentangle the contribution of the information associated with the phenomenological experience of a face (phase) from low-level visual cues (amplitude spectrum, color) in accounting for early face-sensitivity in the human brain. Pictures of faces and of a category of familiar objects (cars), as well as their phase-scrambled versions, were presented to ﬁfteen human participants tested with high-density (128 channels) {EEG}. We replicated an early face-sensitivity – larger response to pictures of faces than cars – at the level of the occipital event-related potential ({ERP}) P1 (80–100 ms). However, a similar larger P1 to phase-scrambled faces than phase-scrambled cars was also found. In contrast, the occipito-temporal N170 was much larger in amplitude for pictures of intact faces than cars, especially in the right hemisphere, while the small N170 elicited by phase-scrambled stimuli did not differ for faces and cars. These ﬁndings show that sensitivity to faces on the visual evoked potentials P1 and N1 (N170) is functionally dissociated: the P1 face-sensitivity is driven by low-level visual cues while the N1 (or N170) face-sensitivity reﬂects the perception of a face. Altogether, these observations indicate that the earliest access to a high-level face representation, that is, a face percept, does not precede the N170 onset in the human brain. Furthermore, they allow resolving apparent discrepancies between the timing of rapid human saccades towards faces and the early activation of high-level facial representations as shown by electrophysiological studies in the primate brain. More generally, they put strong constraints on the interpretation of early (before 100 ms) face-sensitive effects in the human brain.},

These complex identities simultaneously impact social perceivers’ impressions and social targets’ own experiences of identity, thereby shaping perceptions, experiences, and interactions in fundamental ways. This review examines recent research on the perception and experience of the complex, multifaceted identities that both complicate and enrich our lives. Although research has historically tended to focus more on difﬁculties and challenges associated with multiple identities, increasing attention is being paid to opportunities that emerge from the possession of identities that include multiple distinct or overlapping groups. We consider how these opportunities might beneﬁt both perceivers and targets.},

Meanwhile, their hand movements were measured by recording the streaming x, y coordinates of the computer mouse. As participants stereotyped sex-atypical faces, real-time motor responses exhibited a continuous spatial attraction toward the opposite-gender stereotype. These data provide evidence for the partial and parallel activation of stereotypes belonging to alternate social categories. Thus, perceptual cues of the face can trigger a graded mixture of simultaneously active stereotype knowledge tied to alternate social categories, and this mixture settles over time onto ultimate judgments.},

Front. Hum. Neurosci. 9:505. doi: 10.3389/fnhum.2015.00505 Deviant stimuli, violating regularities in a sensory environment, elicit the mismatch negativity ({MMN}), largely described in the Event-Related Potential literature. While it is widely accepted that the {MMN} reﬂects more than basic change detection, a comprehensive description of mental processes modulating this response is still lacking. Within the framework of predictive coding, deviance processing is part of an inference process where prediction errors (the mismatch between incoming sensations and predictions established through experience) are minimized. In this view, the {MMN} is a measure of prediction error, which yields speciﬁc expectations regarding its modulations by various experimental factors. In particular, it predicts that the {MMN} should decrease as the occurrence of a deviance becomes more predictable. We conducted a passive oddball {EEG} study and manipulated the predictability of sound sequences by means of different temporal structures. Importantly, our design allows comparing mismatch responses elicited by predictable and unpredictable violations of a simple repetition rule and therefore departs from previous studies that investigate violations of different time-scale regularities. We observed a decrease of the {MMN} with predictability and interestingly, a similar effect at earlier latencies, within 70 ms after deviance onset. Following these pre-attentive responses, a reduced P3a was measured in the case of predictable deviants. We conclude that early and late deviance responses reﬂect prediction errors, triggering belief updating within the auditory hierarchy. Beside, in this passive study, such perceptual inference appears to be modulated by higher-level implicit learning of sequence statistical structures. Our ﬁndings argue for a hierarchical model of auditory processing where predictive coding enables implicit extraction of environmental regularities.},

We found that the difference waves (novelminus-standard) showed signiﬁcant {MMN} and Novelty-P3 components in the two {WM} load conditions. The amplitude of {MMN} increased with increasing the {WM} load, which indicated a more engaged change detection process under high-load condition. Then, the amplitude of Novelty-P3 was attenuated under high-load condition, which indicated a much reduced involuntary orienting of attention to novel sounds when increasing the {WM} load.

In three experiments, we modified an inattentional blindness paradigm to assess inattentional deafness. Participants made either a low- or high-load visual discrimination concerning a cross shape (respectively, a discrimination of line color or of line length with a subtle length difference). A brief pure tone was presented simultaneously with the visual task display on a final trial. Failures to notice the presence of this tone (i.e., inattentional deafness) reached a rate of 79\% in the high-visual-load condition, significantly more than in the low-load condition. These findings establish the phenomenon of inattentional deafness under visual load, thereby extending the load theory of attention (e.g., Lavie, Journal of Experimental Psychology.

	abstract = {This article examines the role of attention and automaticity in auditory processing as revealed by event-related potential ({ERP}) research. An {ERP} component called the mismatch negativity, generated by the brain's automatic response to changes in repetitive auditory input, reveals that physical features of auditory stimuli are fully processed whether or not they are attended. It also suggests that there exist precise neuronal representations of the physical features of recent auditory stimuli, perhaps the traces underlying acoustic sensory ("echoic") memory. A mechanism of passive attention switching in response to changes in repetitive input is also implicated. Conscious perception of discrete acoustic stimuli might be mediated by some of the mechanisms underlying another {ERP} component (Nl), one sensitive to stimulus onset and offset. Frequent passive attentional shifts might accountforthe effect cognitive psychologists describe as "the breakthrough of the unattended" (Broadbent 1982), that is, that even unattended stimuli may be semantically processed, without assuming automatic semantic processing or late selection in selective attention. The processing negativity supports the early-selection theory and may arise from a mechanism for selectively attending to stimuli defined by certain features. This stimulus selection occurs in the form of a matching process in which each input is compared with the "attentional trace," a voluntarily maintained representation of the task-relevant features of the stimulus to be attended. The attentional mechanism described might underlie the stimulus-set mode of attention proposed by Broadbent. Finally, a model of automatic and attentional processing in audition is proposed that is based mainly on the aforementioned {ERP} components and some other physiological measures.},

Therefore, we applied this approach to the study of peripheral vision.

A technique called “integration-by-prediction” was used to integrate {EEG} and {fMRI} data. In particular, we used vectors of single-trial {ERP} amplitude differences between left and right occipital electrodes as regressors in an {ERP}-informed {fMRI} analysis. The amplitude differences for the regressors were measured at the latencies of the visual P1 and N1 components. Our results indicated that the traditional eventrelated {fMRI} analysis revealed mostly activations in the vicinity of the primary visual cortex and in the ventral visual stream, while both P1 and N1 regressors revealed activation of areas in the temporo-parietal junction. We conclude that simultaneous {EEG}-{fMRI} in a spatial detection task can separate visual processing at 100–200 ms from stimulus onset from the rest of the information processing in the brain.},

	abstract = {Perceptual grouping is the process of organizing sounds into perceptually meaningful elements. Psychological studies have found that tones presented as a regular frequency or temporal pattern are grouped according to gestalt principles, such as similarity, proximity, and good continuity. Predictive coding theory suggests that this process helps create an internal model for the prediction of sounds in a tone sequence and that an omission-related brain response reﬂects the violation of this prediction. However, it remains unclear which brain areas are related to this process, especially in paying attention to the stimuli. To clarify this uncertainty, the present study investigated the neural correlates of perceptual grouping effects. Using magnetoencephalography ({MEG}), we recorded the evoked response ﬁelds ({ERFs}) of amateur musicians and nonmusicians to sound omissions in tone sequences with a regular or random pattern of three different frequencies during an omission detection task. Omissions in the regular sequences were detected faster and evoked greater activity in the left Heschl's gyrus ({HG}), right postcentral gyrus, and bilateral superior temporal gyrus ({STG}) than did omissions in the irregular sequences. Additionally, an interaction between musical experience and regularity was found in the left {HG}/{STG}. Tone-evoked responses did not show this difference, indicating that the expertise effect did not reﬂect the superior tone processing acquired by amateur musicians due to musical training. These results suggest that perceptual grouping based on repetition of a pattern of frequencies affects the processing of omissions in tone sequences and induces more activation of the bilateral auditory cortex by violating internal models. The interaction in the left {HG}/{STG} may suggest different styles of processing for musicians and nonmusicians, although this difference was not reﬂected at the behavioral level.},

	abstract = {The mismatch-negativity ({MMN}) component of the event-related potential ({ERP}) has been extensively used to study the preattentive processing and storage of regularities in basic physical stimulus features (e.g., frequency, intensity, spatial location). However, studies reviewed in the present article reveal that the auditory analysis reﬂected by {MMN} also includes the detection and use of more complex, “abstract”, regularities based, for example, on relationships between various physical features of the stimuli or in patterns present in the auditory stream. When these regularities are violated, then {MMN} is elicited. Thus, the central auditory system performs even at the pre-attentive, auditory-cortex level surprisingly “cognitive” operations, such as generalization leading to simple concept formation, rule extraction and prediction of future stimuli. The information extracted often seems to be in an implicit form, not directly available to conscious processes and difﬁcult to express verbally. It can nevertheless inﬂuence the behavior of the subject, for example, the regularity violations can temporarily impair performance in the primary task. Neural, behavioral and cognitive events associated with the development of the regularity representations are discussed.},

In the phonological condition, which contrasted stimuli from an acoustic /dæ/-/tæ/ continuum, a magnetic mismatch field ({MMF}) was elicited in a sequence of stimuli in which phonological categories occurred in a many-to-one ratio, but no acoustic many-to-one ratio was present. In order to isolate the contribution of phonological categories to the {MMF} responses, the acoustic parameter of voice onset time, which distinguished standard and deviant stimuli, was also varied within the standard and deviant categories. No {MMF} was elicited in the acoustic condition, in which the acoustic distribution of stimuli was identical to the first experiment, but the many-to-one distribution of phonological categories was removed. The design of these studies makes it possible to demonstrate the all-or-nothing property of phonological category membership.

Methods: Pure tone stimuli were given in a passive oddball paradigm with different degrees of deviance between the standard and deviant tones. Amplitude maps of event-related potential ({ERP}) components were generated from the responses, recorded in awake, freely moving animals by a chronically implanted epidural electrode matrix, covering both the primary and secondary auditory ®elds.
Results: The P1 and N1 components appeared with highest amplitude on the middle ectosylvian gyrus, while the amplitude maximum of the {MMN} was ventral and rostral to them on the {AII} area. Both the latency and the peak amplitude of the {MMN} depended on the degree of deviance.
Conclusions: The {MMN} is generated in the rostroventral part of the secondary auditory area, well separated from the sources of the P1 and N1 components. q 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {One account of the early versus late selection debate in attention proposes that perceptual load determines the locus of selection. Attention selects stimuli at a late processing level under low-load conditions but selects stimuli at an early level under high-load conditions. Despite the successes of perceptual load theory, a noncircular definition of perceptual load remains elusive. We investigated the factors that influence perceptual load by using manipulations that have been studied extensively in visual search, namely target– distractor similarity and distractor– distractor similarity. Consistent with previous work, search was most efficient when targets and distractors were dissimilar and the displays contained homogeneous distractors; search became less efficient when target– distractor similarity increased irrespective of display heterogeneity. Importantly, we used these same stimuli in a typical perceptual load task that measured attentional spillover to a task-irrelevant flanker. We found a strong correspondence between search efficiency and perceptual load; stimuli that generated efficient searches produced flanker interference effects, suggesting that such displays involved low perceptual load. Flanker interference effects were reduced in displays that produced less efficient searches. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that search difficulty, as measured by search intercept, has little bearing on perceptual load. We conclude that rather than be arbitrarily defined, perceptual load might be defined by well-characterized, continuous factors that influence visual search.},

	abstract = {Objective: When investigating auditory perceptual regularity processing, mismatch negativity ({MMN}) is commonly used. {MMN} is computed as a difference signal between the event-related potentials ({ERPs}) elicited by repeated standard tones and rarely occurring deviant tones. This procedure leads to an underestimation of the N1 component elicited by standards compared to the N1 to deviants which might affect the {MMN}. Consequently, a random control design was previously introduced. This design, however, overestimates the N1 to the deviant. Here, we developed a new paradigm that avoids previous drawbacks.
Methods: We designed a regular cascadic sequence as a control to the deviant. {ERPs} were measured while presenting conventional oddball blocks (standards, deviants), random control blocks and a cascadic control block.
Results: {MMN} was observed in each difference signal. Regarding the N1, standards elicited smallest amplitudes. The N1 for the deviant and the cascadic control was comparable. The largest N1 was elicited by the random control.
Conclusion: Standards underestimate N1 refractoriness effects in the responses to deviants, while random control tones overestimate. Cascadic control tones, however, provide a reasonable estimation for the N1.},

	abstract = {The classic account of the load theory ({LT}) of attention suggests that increasing cognitive load leads to greater processing of task-irrelevant stimuli due to competition for limited executive resource that reduces the ability to actively maintain current processing priorities. Studies testing this hypothesis have yielded widely divergent outcomes. The inconsistent results may, in part, be related to variability in executive capacity ({EC}) and task difﬁculty across subjects in different studies. Here, we used a cross-modal paradigm to investigate whether augmented working memory ({WM}) load leads to increased early distracter processing, and controlled for the potential confounders of {EC} and task difﬁculty. Twenty-three young subjects were engaged in a primary visual {WM} task, under high and low load conditions, while instructed to ignore irrelevant auditory stimuli. Demands of the high load condition were individually titrated to make task difﬁculty comparable across subjects with differing {EC}. Event-related potentials ({ERPs}) were used to measure neural activity in response to stimuli presented in both the task relevant modality (visual) and task-irrelevant modality (auditory). Behavioral results indicate that the load manipulation and titration procedure of the primary visual task were successful. {ERPs} demonstrated that in response to visual target stimuli, there was a load-related increase in the posterior slow wave, an index of sustained attention and effort. Importantly, under high load, there was a decrease of the auditory N1 in response to distracters, a marker of early auditory processing. These results suggest that increased {WM} load is associated with enhanced attentional engagement and protection from distraction in a cross-modal setting, even after controlling for task difﬁculty and {EC}. Our ﬁndings challenge the classic {LT} and offer support for alternative models.},

Target deviants elicit a P300 with maximum amplitude over parieto– central recording sites while the ‘P300’ elicited by deviant nontarget stimuli occurs somewhat earlier and shows a more frontally-oriented scalp distribution. Two varieties of frontal P300s have been described, elicited either by rare stimuli (target or nontarget) presented in a two-stimulus oddball task (P3a) or by infrequent, unrecognizable stimuli presented in the context of a three-stimulus oddball task (Novelty-P3).

Twenty highly trained participants performed the two tasks together, either while detecting secondary task deviant tones in one ear and ignoring tones in the other ear {\textasciitilde}dual condition! or while ignoring the tones in both ears {\textasciitilde}ignore condition!. The amplitude of the N100–P200 complex in both the dual-task and ignore conditions was reduced equally in the attended and unattended ear by the introduction of the primary task. In the dual-task condition, the amplitude of the late Nd but not the early Nd was reduced by a combination of the introduction of the primary task and an increase in its difficulty. P300 showed the same amplitude pattern as the late Nd. We propose that the reduction in N100–P200 amplitude reflects an automatic gating mechanism. The dissociation of the early and late Nd suggests that the latter is not modality specific. The question is raised whether the late Nd is more closely associated with P300 than with the early Nd.},

The participants categorized visual targets across six blocks of trials. Each target was preceded either by a standard sound or, on rare trials, by a deviant. The magnitude of the deviation effect (i.e., prolonged response time when the deviant was presented) was relatively large in the beginning but attenuated toward the end. There was no relationship between {WMC} and the deviation effect at the beginning, but there was at the end, and greater {WMC} was associated with greater habituation. These results indicate that high memory ability increases habituation rate, and they support theories proposing a role for cognitive control in habituation and in some forms of auditory distraction.},

Because it is unresolved if the duration {MMN} depends on sound pressure level ({SPL}), we studied effects of different {SPLs} (56, 66, and 76 {dB}) on the duration {MMN}. Further, previous research suggests that the {MMN} is reduced by a concurrent visual task. Because a recent behavioral study found that high visual perceptual load strongly reduced detection sensitivity to irrelevant sounds, we studied if the duration {MMN} is reduced by load, and if this reduction is stronger at low {SPLs}. Although a duration {MMN} was observed for all {SPLs}, the {MMN} was apparently not moderated strongly by {SPL}, perceptual load, or their interaction, because all 95\% {CIs} overlapped zero. In a contrast analysis of the {MMN} (across loads) between the 56-{dB} and 76-{dB} groups, evidence ({BF} = 0.31) favored the null hypothesis that duration {MMN} is unaffected by a 20-{dB} increase in {SPL}. Similarly, evidence ({BF} = 0.19) favored the null hypothesis that effects of perceptual load on the duration {MMN} do not change with a 20-{dB} increase in {SPL}. However, evidence ({BF} = 3.12) favored the alternative hypothesis that the effect of perceptual load in the present study resembled the overall effect in a recent meta-analysis. When the present ﬁndings were combined with the meta-analysis, the effect of load (low minus high) was −0.43 ␮V, 95\% {CI} [−0.64, −0.22] suggesting that the duration {MMN} decreases with load.

The present study investigated whether stimulus parameters (sound type and duration) exert a diﬀerential inﬂuence on the {MMN} for a duration decrement and increment of an equal magnitude. Some asymmetries were reported in the previous studies; yet no systematical study has been conducted.
Methods: {ERPs} were recorded from 16 healthy adults presented with repetitive standard sounds interspersed with duration changes (deviant sounds). In separate sequences, stimuli were vowels, music chord, sinusoid, or band-pass ﬁltered white noise. The stimulus durations (standard/deviant) were either 200/120 ms or 400/240 ms for decrements, and vice versa for increments.
Results: The {MMN} for the increments was abolished in the 400/240 ms condition, whereas the {MMN} for decrements was signiﬁcant irrespective of the sound duration. The amplitude of the increment {MMN} paralleled with the spectral complexity of the stimulus sound, whereas that of the decrement {MMN} was larger for natural sounds than artiﬁcial sounds.
Conclusions: The observed interactions demonstrated asymmetries in the {MMN} for duration increment and decrement. Signiﬁcance: The present ﬁndings suggest that the eﬀects of stimulus parameters should be taken into account when comparing diﬀerent studies, especially where clinical populations are involved, with one another.

	abstract = {Event-related potentials ({ERPs}) to different types of infrequent change in a tone pair composed of two closely spaced tones of different frequencies were recorded. The mismatch negativity ({MMN}), a change-specific component of the {ERP}, was elicited by reversing the order of the two tones, by repeating the first tone, by replacing the first tone with the second tone, or by omitting the second tone. The omission of the second tone, however, elicited the {MMN} only when the interval between the two tones was very short (offset to onset 40 or 140 ms) but did not when this interval was somewhat longer (240 or 340 ms). The pattern of the present results suggests that sensory-memory traces, as reflected by the {MMN}, integrate information about two closely spaced stimuli into a unitary sensory event.},

Each of the 5 subjects was measured 6 times in two recording sessions. Responses to monaural stimuli were recorded from 122 {MEG} and 64 {EEG} channels simultaneously. The {EEG} data were modeled with a symmetrically-located dipole pair. For the {MEG} data, one dipole in each hemisphere was located independently using a subset of channels. Standard deviation ({SD}) was used as a measure for replicability. The average {SD} of the x, y and z coordinates of the contralateral N1m dipole was about 2 mm, whereas the corresponding ﬁgures for the ipsilateral N1m and the contra- and ipsilateral N1 were about twice as large. The {SDs} of the dipole amplitudes and latencies were almost equal with {MEG} and {EEG}. The amplitude and latency measures of the {MEG} ﬁeld gradient waveforms were almost as replicable as those of the dipole models. The results suggest that both {MEG} and {EEG} can be used for investigating the simultaneous activity of the left and right auditory cortices independently, {MEG} being superior in certain experimental setups. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

	abstract = {The automatic detection of deviations within a constant sine wave tone is confined to the initial part of approximately 350 ms. When a deviation occurs beyond this critical limit, the mismatch negativity ({MMN}) - a deviance-related component of the event-related potential –is largely attenuated or even absent. However, for time-variant acoustic stimuli such as speech sounds or tonal patterns, {MMN} is also obtained for deviations beyond the initial 350 ms. We consider two hypotheses that can explain the {MMN} to time-variant sounds. One is that the terminal part of those sounds is represented as the spectral information varies over time (spectral-variation hypothesis). The other is that transients, occurring in timevariant signals, help to segment the long sounds into smaller units, each being not larger than the critical 350 ms (segmentation hypothesis). We measured {MMN} to duration shortenings (deviants) embedded in a sequence of 1000 ms long standard tones of increasing frequency (sweeps). The sweeps did or did not contain a noise burst. Results reveal a lack of {MMN} to the duration deviant in the sweep without a noise burst, which rules out the spectral-variation hypothesis. The presence of {MMN} to the duration deviant in the sweep with a noise burst supports the segmentation hypothesis. Thus, the results suggest a temporal constraint inherent to the processing of unstructured/unsegmented long tones. We argue that transients within a sound act as segmentation cues providing an automatic sound representation for which deviations can be detected.},

	abstract = {The widely accepted “memory-mismatch” interpretation of the mismatch negativity ({MMN}) event-related brain potential ({ERP}) suggests that an {MMN} is elicited when an acoustic event deviates from a memory record describing the immediate history of the sound sequence. The first variant of the memory-mismatch theory suggested that the memory underlying {MMN} generation was a strong auditory sensory memory trace, which encoded the repetitive standard sound. This “trace-mismatch” explanation of {MMN} has been primarily based on results obtained in the auditory oddball paradigm. However, in recent years, {MMN} has been observed in stimulus paradigms containing no frequently repeating sound. We now suggest a different variant of the memory-mismatch interpretation of {MMN} in order to provide a unified explanation of all {MMN} phenomena. The regularity-violation explanation of {MMN} assumes that the memory records retaining the history of auditory stimulation are regularity representations. These representations encode rules extracted from the regular intersound relationships, which are mapped to the concrete sound sequence by finely detailed auditory sensory information. Auditory events are compared with temporally aligned predictions drawn from the regularity representations (predictive models) and the observable {MMN} response reflects a process updating the representations of those detected regularities whose prediction was mismatched by the acoustic input. It is further suggested that the auditory deviance detection system serves to organize sound in the brain: The predictive models maintained by the {MMN}-generating process provide the basis of temporal grouping, a crucial step in the formation of auditory objects.},

To know whether a non-signiﬁcant result counts against a theory, or if it just indicates data insensitivity, researchers must use one of: power, intervals (such as conﬁdence or credibility intervals), or else an indicator of the relative evidence for one theory over another, such as a Bayes factor. I argue Bayes factors allow theory to be linked to data in a way that overcomes the weaknesses of the other approaches. Speciﬁcally, Bayes factors use the data themselves to determine their sensitivity in distinguishing theories (unlike power), and they make use of those aspects of a theory’s predictions that are often easiest to specify (unlike power and intervals, which require specifying the minimal interesting value in order to address theory). Bayes factors provide a coherent approach to determining whether non-signiﬁcant results support a null hypothesis over a theory, or whether the data are just insensitive. They allow accepting and rejecting the null hypothesis to be put on an equal footing. Concrete examples are provided to indicate the range of application of a simple online Bayes calculator, which reveal both the strengths and weaknesses of Bayes factors.},

Bayesian statistics is well suited to the task of ﬁnding supporting evidence for constraint, because it allows for comparing evidence for 2 hypotheses against each another. One issue in hypothesis testing is that constraints may hold only approximately rather than exactly, and the reason for small deviations may be trivial or uninteresting. In the large-sample limit, these uninteresting, small deviations lead to the rejection of a useful constraint. In this article, we develop several Bayes factor 1-sample tests for the assessment of approximate equality and ordinal constraints. In these tests, the null hypothesis covers a small interval of non-0 but negligible effect sizes around 0. These Bayes factors are alternatives to previously developed Bayes factors, which do not allow for interval null hypotheses, and may especially prove useful to researchers who use statistical equivalence testing. To facilitate adoption of these Bayes factor tests, we provide easy-to-use software.},

	abstract = {The Bayes factor is an intuitive and principled model selection tool from Bayesian statistics. The Bayes factor quantifies the relative likelihood of the observed data under two competing models, and as such, it measures the evidence that the data provides for one model versus the other. Unfortunately, computation of the Bayes factor often requires sampling-based procedures that are not trivial to implement. In this tutorial, we explain and illustrate the use of one such procedure, known as the product space method (Carlin \& Chib, 1995). This is a transdimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo method requiring the construction of a ‘‘supermodel’’ encompassing the models under consideration. A model index measures the proportion of times that either model is visited to account for the observed data. This proportion can then be transformed to yield a Bayes factor. We discuss the theory behind the product space method and illustrate, by means of applied examples from psychological research, how the method can be implemented in practice.},

In recent years, serious challenges to the gender binary have arisen from both academic research and social activism. This review describes 5 sets of empirical findings, spanning multiple disciplines, that fundamentally undermine the gender binary. These sources of evidence include neuroscience findings that refute sexual dimorphism of the human brain; behavioral neuroendocrinology findings that challenge the notion of genetically fixed, nonoverlapping, sexually dimorphic hormonal systems; psychological findings that highlight the similarities between men and women; psychological research on transgender and nonbinary individuals’ identities and experiences; and developmental research suggesting that the tendency to view gender/sex as a meaningful, binary category is culturally determined and malleable. Costs associated with reliance on the gender binary and recommendations for future research, as well as clinical practice, are outlined.},

	abstract = {Different strategies of gender-fair language have been applied to reduce a male bias, which means the implicit belief that a word describing an undefined person describes a man. This male bias might be caused by the words themselves in terms of generic masculine or masculine forms or by androcentrism (the conflation of men with humanity). In two experiments, we tested how different gender-fair strategies used as labels of an unknown social target (an applicant in a recruitment situation) could eliminate the male bias. The three types of gender-fair strategies tested were: (a) paired forms (he/she), (b) traditional neutral words (e.g., singular they, Bthe applicant{\textasciicircum}), or (c) gender-neutral third-person pronouns actively created to challenge the binary gender system (ze, Swedish hen). The two experiments were performed in Swedish with 417 undergraduates in Sweden and in English with 411 U.S. participants recruited online. In Swedish, the third-person gender-neutral pronoun singular (hen) was used. In English, several forms of such gender-neutral pronouns have been suggested (e.g., ze). In both experiments, results indicated that paired forms and actively created gender-neutral pronouns eliminated the male bias, whereas traditional neutral words contained a male bias. Thus, gender-fair language strategies should avoid using traditional words. Consequences of using paired forms and creating new gender-neutral words are discussed. We argue that an actively created gender-neutral pronoun is of highest value because it is more inclusive.},

Rouder (2014) argues that optional stopping is no problem for Bayesians, and even recommends the use of optional stopping in practice, as do Wagenmakers et al. (2012). This article addresses the question whether optional stopping is problematic for Bayesian methods, and speciﬁes under which circumstances and in which sense it is and is not. By slightly varying and extending Rouder’s (2014) experiment, we illustrate that, as soon as the parameters of interest are equipped with default or pragmatic priors — which means, in most practical applications of Bayes factor hypothesis testing — resilience to optional stopping can break down. We distinguish between four types of default priors, each having their own speciﬁc issues with optional stopping, ranging from no-problem-at-all (Type 0 priors) to quite severe (Type {II} and {III} priors).},

	abstract = {Bayes factors provide a symmetrical measure of evidence for one model versus another (e.g. H1 versus H0) in order to relate theory to data. These properties help solve some (but not all) of the problems underlying the credibility crisis in psychology. The symmetry of the measure of evidence means that there can be evidence for H0 just as much as for H1; or the Bayes factor may indicate insufficient evidence either way. P-values cannot make this three-way distinction. Thus, Bayes factors indicate when the data count against a theory (and when they count for nothing); and thus they indicate when replications actually support H0 or H1 (in ways that power cannot). There is every reason to publish evidence supporting the null as going against it, because the evidence can be measured to be just as strong either way (thus the published record can be more balanced). Bayes factors can be B-hacked but they mitigate the problem because a) they allow evidence in either direction so people will be less tempted to hack in just one direction; b) as a measure of evidence they are insensitive to the stopping rule; c) families of tests cannot be arbitrarily defined; and d) falsely implying a contrast is planned rather than post hoc becomes irrelevant (though the value of pre-registration is not mitigated).},

The next four, however, show that the methods will also often disagree. In these cases, the aim of the paper will be to motivate the sensible evidential conclusion, and then see which approach matches those intuitions. Specifically, it is shown that a high-powered non-significant result is consistent with no evidence for H0 over H1 worth mentioning, which a Bayes factor can show, and, conversely, that a low-powered non-significant result is consistent with substantial evidence for H0 over H1, again indicated by Bayesian analyses. The fourth study illustrates that a highpowered significant result may not amount to any evidence for H1 over H0, matching the Bayesian conclusion. Finally, the fifth study illustrates that different theories can be evidentially supported to different degrees by the same data; a fact that P-values cannot reflect but Bayes factors can. It is argued that appropriate conclusions match the Bayesian inferences, but not those based on significance testing, where they disagree.},

Psychologists can improve research practices to advance knowledge in ways that improve replicability.

	abstract = {Developmental stability reﬂects the ability of a genotype to undergo stable development of a phenotype under given environmental conditions. Deviations from developmental stability arise from the disruptive eﬀects of a wide range of environmental and genetic stresses, and such deviations are usually measured in terms of ﬂuctuating asymmetry and phenodeviants. Fluctuating asymmetry is the most sensitive indicator of the ability to cope with stresses during ontogeny. There is considerable evidence that developmental stability, and especially ﬂuctuating asymmetry, is a useful measure of phenotypic and genetic quality, because it covaries negatively with performance in multiple ﬁtness domains in many species, including humans. It is proposed that developmental stability is an important marker of human health. Our goal is to initiate formally the integration of the sciences of evolutionary biology, developmental biology and medicine. We believe that this integrative framework provides a signiﬁcant addition to the growing ﬁeld of Darwinian medicine. The literature linking developmental stability and disease in humans is reviewed. Recent biological theoretical treatments pertaining to developmental stability are applied to a range of human health issues such as genetic diseases, ageing and survival, subfertility, abortion, child maltreatment by parents, cancer, infectious diseases, physiological and mental health, and physical attractiveness as a health certiﬁcation.},

Gender ambiguous faces were created by morphing male and female source faces. In Study 1, the recollection of moderately ambiguous faces (i.e., 70\% male–30\% female faces and 70\% female–30\% male faces) was accentuated towards face distracters that were more typical of the spontaneous (i.e., face-based) categorization of these faces. In Study 2, the recollection of extremely ambiguous faces (50\% male–50\% female faces) was accentuated towards face distracters that were more typical of the gender category suggested by context cues attached to these faces prior to the face presentation. Study 3 relied on the same design as Study 2, but this time context cues were provided after face encoding. In line with predictions, no accentuation {eVect} emerged under the latter conditions. The theoretical and practical implications of these Wndings are discussed.},

We found that facial cues to body height and weight had substantial and independent effects on the perception of masculinity. Our findings suggest that men are perceived as more masculine if they appear taller and heavier, independent of how much their face shape differs from women’s.

We examined whether the perceived valence of a complex scene is subject to aftereffects, by observing the participants’ evaluation of the valence of a test picture preceded by a different picture. For this study, we employed an adaptation paradigm with positive and negative images used as adapters, and positive, negative, and neutral images used as tests. Our results show that adaptation to complex emotional pictures induces assimilative aftereffects: participants judged neutral tests more positively following positive adapters and more negatively following negative adapters. This depended on the prolonged adaptation phase (10 s), as the results of a second experiment, in which adapters lasted for 500 ms, did not show aftereffects. In addition, the results show that assimilative aftereffects of negative and positive adapters also manifested themselves on non-neutral (negative and positive) targets, providing evidence that the global emotional content of complex pictures is suitable to induce assimilative aftereffects.},

	abstract = {Visual adaptation is known to bias perception away from the properties of the adapting stimuli, toward opposite properties, resulting in perceptual aftereffects. For example, prolonged exposure to a face has been shown to produce an identity aftereffect, biasing perception of a subsequent face toward the opposite identity. Such repulsive aftereffects have been observed for both visually perceived and visually imagined faces, suggesting that both perception and imagery yield typical aftereffects. However, recent studies have reported opposite patterns of aftereffects for perception and imagery of face gender. In these studies, visually perceived faces produced typical effects in which perception of androgynous faces was biased away from the gender of the adaptor, whereas imagery of the same stimuli produced atypical aftereffects, biasing the perceived gender of androgynous faces toward the gender of the adaptor. These findings are highly unusual and warrant further research. The present study aimed to gather new evidence on the direction of gender aftereffects following perception and imagery of faces. Experiment 1 had participants view and imagine female and male faces of famous and nonfamous individuals. To determine the effect of concomitant visual stimulation on imagery and adaptation, participants visualized faces both in the presence and in the absence of a visual input. In Experiment 2, participants were adapted to perceived and imagined faces of famous and non-famous actors matched on gender typicality. This manipulation allowed us to determine the effect of face familiarity on the magnitude of gender aftereffects. Contrary to evidence from previous studies, our results demonstrated that both perception and imagery produced typical aftereffects, biasing the perceived gender of androgynous faces in the opposite direction to the gender of the adaptor. Famous faces yielded largest adaptation effects across tasks. Experiment 2 confirmed that these effects depended on familiarity rather than on sexual dimorphism. In both experiments, this effect was greater for perception than imagery. Additionally, imagery of famous faces produced strongest aftereffects when it was performed in the absence of visual stimulation. The implications of these findings are discussed.},

Rouder (2014) argues that optional stopping is no problem for Bayesians, and even recommends the use of optional stopping in practice, as do Wagenmakers et al. (2012). This article addresses the question whether optional stopping is problematic for Bayesian methods, and speciﬁes under which circumstances and in which sense it is and is not. By slightly varying and extending Rouder’s (2014) experiment, we illustrate that, as soon as the parameters of interest are equipped with default or pragmatic priors — which means, in most practical applications of Bayes factor hypothesis testing — resilience to optional stopping can break down. We distinguish between four types of default priors, each having their own speciﬁc issues with optional stopping, ranging from no-problem-at-all (Type 0 priors) to quite severe (Type {II} and {III} priors).},

Using an adaptation paradigm, we examined aftereffects on expression perception produced by various stimuli. Adapting to a face, which was used to create morphs between two expressions, substantially biased expression perception within the morphed faces away from the adapting expression. This adaptation was not based on low-level image properties, as a different image of the same person displaying that expression produced equally robust aftereffects. Smaller but significant aftereffects were generated by images of different individuals, irrespective of gender. Non-face visual, auditory, or verbal representations of emotion did not generate significant aftereffects. These results suggest that adaptation affects at least two neural representations of expression: one specific to the individual (not the image), and one that represents expression across different facial identities. The identity-independent aftereffect suggests the existence of a ‘visual semantic’ for facial expression in the human visual system.},

We here report that the face identity-specific aftereffect requires a visible face; it is effectively cancelled by binocular suppression or by inattentional blindness of the inducing face. Conversely, the same suppression does not interfere with the orientation-specific aftereffect. Thus, the competition between incompatible or interfering visual inputs to reach awareness is resolved before those aspects of information that are exploited in face identification are processed. We also found that the face aftereffect remained intact when the visual distracters in the inattention experiment were replaced with auditory distracters. Thus, cross-modal or cognitive interference that does not affect the visibility of the face does not interfere with the face aftereffect. We conclude that adaptation to face identity depends on seeing the face.},

Here, two studies demonstrated the involvement of a different kind of competition. In Study 1, before participants selected the correct sex category for morphed faces, their mouse trajectories often exhibited a continuous attraction toward the incorrect category that increased with sex-category ambiguity, indicating continuous competition. On other trials, however, trajectories initially pursued the incorrect category and then abruptly redirected toward the correct category, suggesting early incorrect category activation that was rapidly reversed later in processing. These abrupt category reversals also increased with ambiguity. In Study 2, participants were presented with faces containing a sextypical or sex-atypical hair cue, in a context in which the norm was either sex-typical targets (normative context) or sex-atypical targets (counternormative context). Sexatypical targets induced greater competition in the normative context, but sex-typical targets induced greater competition in the counternormative context. Together, these results demonstrate that categorizing others involves both smooth competition and abrupt category shifts, and that these flexibly adapt to the social context.},

The wealth of information provided by facial cues presents challenges to our understanding of these early stages of person perception. The current study aimed to uncover the dynamics of processing multiply categorizable faces, notably as a function of their gender and age. Using a modified four-choice version of a mouse-tracking paradigm (which assesses the relative dominance of two categorical dimensions), the relative influence that sex and age have on each other during categorization of infant, younger adult, and older adult faces was investigated. Results of these experiments demonstrate that when sex and age dimensions are simultaneously categorized, only for infant faces does age influence sex categorization. In contrast, the sex of both young and older adults was shown to influence age categorization. The functional implications of these findings are discussed in light of previous person perception research.},

Growing evidence for continuous dynamics in real-time cognition suggests, contrary to prevailing social psychological accounts, that person construal may involve dynamic competition between simultaneously active representations. To test this, the authors examined social categorization in real-time by streaming the x, y coordinates of hand movements as participants categorized typical and atypical faces by sex. Though judgments of atypical targets were largely accurate, online motor output exhibited a continuous spatial attraction toward the opposite sex category, indicating dynamic competition between multiple social category alternatives. The authors offer a dynamic continuity account of social categorization and provide converging evidence across categorizations of real male and female faces (containing a typical or an atypical sex-specifying cue) and categorizations of computer-generated male and female faces (with subtly morphed sex-typical or sex-atypical features). In 3 studies, online motor output revealed continuous dynamics underlying person construal, in which multiple simultaneously and partially active category representations gradually cascade into social categorical judgments. Such evidence is challenging for discrete stage-based accounts.},

	abstract = {We investigated whether male and female faces are discrete categories at the perceptual level. We created artiﬁcial gender continua between male and female faces using a 3D-morphing algorithm and used classical categorization and discrimination tasks to investigate categorical perception of gender. In Experiments 1 and 3, 3D morphs were computed between male and female faces. The results of the discrimination task suggest that the gender of unfamiliar faces is not categorically perceived. When participants were familiarized with the male and female endpoint faces before testing (Experiment 3), a categorical effect was found. In Experiment 2, only shape or texture of unfamiliar 3D morphs was indicative of gender, while other information (e.g. texture or shape) was kept constant. Again there was no evidence of a categorical effect in the discrimination task. In Experiments 1, 2 and 3, changes in the gender of a face were also coupled with changes in identity which may have confounded the ﬁndings. In Experiments 4 and 5, we used face continua in which only the gender of the facial features changed, while the characteristic of the facial features remained constant. When the faces were unfamiliar (Experiment 4), there was no evidence of categorical perception of gender. In Experiment 5, participants learned to classify the face images in two gender categories using a feedback procedure. A clear categorical effect for gender was present after training. Our ﬁndings suggest that despite the importance of faces, gender information present in faces is not naturally perceived categorically. Consequently participants showed categorical perception of gender only after training with the face stimulus set.},

	abstract = {Faces are complex visual objects, and faces chosen to vary in 1 regard may unintentionally vary in other ways, particularly if the correlation is a property of the population of faces. Here, we present an example of a correlation that arises from differences in the degree of sexual dimorphism. In Experiment 1, paired similarity ratings were collected for a set of 40 real face images chosen to vary in terms of gender and race (Asian vs. White). Multidimensional scaling ({MDS}) placed these stimuli in a “face space,” with different attributes corresponding to different dimensions. Gender was found to vary more for White faces, resulting in a negative or positive correlation between gender and race when only considering male or only considering female faces. This increased sexual dimorphism for White faces may provide an alternative explanation for differences in face processing between White and Asian faces (e.g., the own-race bias, face attractiveness biases, etc.). Studies of face processing that are unconfounded by this difference in the degree of sexual dimorphism require stimuli that are decorrelated in terms of race and gender. Decorrelated faces were created using a morphing technique, spacing the morphs uniformly around a ring in the 2-dimensional (2D) race– gender plane. In Experiment 2, paired similarity ratings confirmed the 2D positions of the morph faces. In Experiment 3, race and gender category judgments varied uniformly for these decorrelated stimuli. Our results and stimuli should prove useful for studying sexual dimorphism and for the study of face processing more generally.},

We examined the role of gender in the neural representation of faces using a contrast-based adaptation method. If faces of different genders share the same representational face space, then adaptation to a face of one gender should affect both same- and different-gender faces. Further, if these aftereffects differ in magnitude, this may indicate distinct gender-related factors in the organization of this face space. To control for a potential confound between physical similarity and gender, we used a Bayesian ideal observer and human discrimination data to construct a stimulus set in which pairs of different-gender faces were equally dissimilar as same-gender pairs. We found that the recognition of both samegender and different-gender faces was suppressed following a brief exposure of 100ms. Moreover, recognition was more suppressed for test faces of a different-gender than those of the same-gender as the adaptor, despite the equivalence in physical and psychophysical similarity. Our results suggest that male and female faces likely occupy the same face space, allowing transfer of aftereffects between the genders, but that there are special properties that emerge along genderdefining dimensions of this space.},

Recognition of familiar faces is also highly accurate across a very large range of viewing conditions, despite the difficulty of the problem. Here we show that computation of sex and race can emerge incidentally from a system designed to compute identity. We emphasise the role of multiple encounters with a small number of people, which we take to underlie human face learning. We use highly variable everyday Ô{ambientÕ} images of a few people to train a Linear Discriminant Analysis ({LDA}) model on identity. The resulting model has human-like properties, including a facility to cohere previously unseen ambient images of familiar (trained) people Ð an ability which breaks down for the faces of unknown (untrained) people. The first dimension created by the identity-trained {LDA} classifies both familiar and unfamiliar faces by sex, and the second dimension classifies faces by race Ð even though neither of these categories was explicitly coded at learning. By varying the numbers and types of face identities on which a further series of {LDA} models were trained, we show that this incidental learning of sex and race reflects covariation between these social categories and face identity, and that a remarkably small number of identities need be learnt before such incidental dimensions emerge. The task of learning to recognise familiar faces is sufficient to create certain salient social categories.},

We used morphed continua between two face identities and we assessed, through a masked priming paradigm, the perceptual processing of these morphed faces under subliminal and supraliminal conditions. We found that priming from subliminal faces followed linearly the information present in the primes, while priming from visible faces revealed a non-linear proﬁle, indicating a categorical processing of face identities. Our results thus point to a special relation between perceptual awareness and categorical processing of faces, and support the dissociation between two modes of information processing: a subliminal mode involving analog treatment of stimuli information, and a supraliminal mode relying on discrete representation.},

For sex however, which represents another important and biologically relevant dimension of human faces, results have been equivocal so far. Here, we reinvestigate {CP} for sex using newly created face stimuli to control two factors that to our opinion might have inﬂuenced the results in earlier studies. Our new stimuli are (a) derived from single face identities, so that changes of sex are not confounded with changes of identity information, and (b) ‘‘normalized’’ in their degree of maleness and femaleness, to counteract natural variations of perceived masculinity and femininity of faces that might obstruct evidence of categorical perception. Despite careful normalization, we did not ﬁnd evidence of {CP} for sex using classical test procedures, unless participants were speciﬁcally familiarized with the face identities before testing. These results support the single-route hypothesis, stating that sex and identity information in faces are not processed in parallel, in contrast to what was suggested in the classical Bruce and Young model of face perception.},

It assumes that the perception of other people is accomplished by a dynamical system involving continuous interaction between social categories, stereotypes, high-level cognitive states, and the low-level processing of facial, vocal, and bodily cues. This system permits lower-level sensory perception and higher-order social cognition to dynamically coordinate across multiple interactive levels of processing to give rise to stable person construals. A recurrent connectionist model of this system is described, which accounts for major findings on a) partial parallel activation and dynamic competition in categorization and stereotyping; b) top-down influences of high-level cognitive states and stereotype activations on categorization; c) bottom-up category interactions due to shared perceptual features; and d) contextual and cross-modal effects on categorization. The system’s probabilistic and continuously evolving activation states permit multiple construals to be flexibly active in parallel. These activation states are also able to be tightly yoked to ongoing changes in external perceptual cues and to ongoing changes in high-level cognitive states. The implications of a rapidly adaptive, dynamic, and interactive person construal system are discussed.},

Herein, we present a functional forecast approach to understanding compound social cue processing that emphasizes the importance of shared social affordances across various cues (see too Adams et al. In The science of social vision, ed. R.B. Adams Jr., N. Ambady, K. Nakayama, and S. Shimojo. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010b; Adams and Nelson In The handbook of social neuroscience, ed. J. Decety and J. Cacioppo. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011; Weisbuch and Adams Social and Personality Psychology Compass 6: 499–514, 2012). We review the traditional theories of emotion and face processing that argued for dissociable and noninteracting pathways (e.g., for specific emotional expressions, gaze, identity cues), as well as more recent evidence for combinatorial processing of social cues. We argue here that early, and presumably reflexive, visual integration of such cues is necessary for adaptive behavioral responding to others. In support of this claim, we review contemporary work that reveals a flexible visual system, one that readily incorporates meaningful contextual influences in even nonsocial visual processing, thereby establishing the functional and neuroanatomical bases necessary for compound social cue integration. Finally, we explicate three likely mechanisms driving such integration. Together, this work implicates a role for cognitive penetrability in visual perceptual abilities that have often been (and in some cases still are) ascribed to direct encapsulated perceptual processes.},

	abstract = {From only brief exposure to a face, individuals spontaneously categorize another’s race. Recent behavioral evidence suggests that visual context may affect such categorizations. We used {fMRI} to examine the neural basis of contextual inﬂuences on the race categorization of faces. Participants categorized the race of faces that varied along a White-Asian morph continuum and were surrounded by American, neutral, or Chinese scene contexts. As expected, the context systematically inﬂuenced categorization responses and their efﬁciency (response times). Neuroimaging results indicated that the retrosplenial cortex ({RSC}) and orbitofrontal cortex ({OFC}) exhibited highly sensitive, graded responses to the compatibility of facial and contextual cues. These regions showed linearly increasing responses as a face became more White when in an American context, and linearly increasing responses as a face became more Asian when in a Chinese context. Further, {RSC} activity partially mediated the effect of this face-context compatibility on the efﬁciency of categorization responses. Together, the ﬁndings suggest a critical role of the {RSC} and {OFC} in driving contextual inﬂuences on face categorization, and highlight the impact of extraneous cues beyond the face in categorizing other people.},

	abstract = {Separate neuroscience experiments have examined two properties of neural coding for perceptual stimuli. Adaptation studies seek a graded recovery from neural adaptation with ever greater dissimilarity between pairs of stimuli. Studies of prototype effects test for a larger absolute response to a stimulus which is distant from the center of a stimulus space. While intellectually distinct, these effects are confounded in measurement in standard neuroscience paradigms and can be mistaken for one another. Stimuli which are more distinctive are less subject to adaptation from perceptual neighbors. Therefore, a putative prototype effect may simply result from greater adaptation of prototypical stimuli by other stimuli in the experiment. Conversely, stimulus pairs which are the most perceptually distant from one another, and therefore expected to show the greatest recovery from adaptation, disproportionately draw from the extremes of the stimulus space. Thus, an apparent neural similarity effect may be created by an underlying prototype representation. We simulate {BOLD} {fMRI} results driven by each possible effect and demonstrate spurious results in support of the complementary effect. We then present an example {fMRI} experiment that demonstrates the confound and how it may be minimized. Finally, we discuss the implications of this intrinsic confound for studies of perceptual representation, neural coding, and category learning.},

It is not yet clear if adaptation effects in humans extend beyond this set of higher order features. The aim of this study was to investigate whether objects highly associated with one gender, e.g. high heels for females or electric shavers for males can modulate gender perception of a face. In two separate experiments, we adapted subjects to a series of objects highly associated with one gender and subsequently asked participants to judge the gender of an ambiguous face. Results showed that participants are more likely to perceive an ambiguous face as male after being exposed to objects highly associated to females and vice versa. A gender adaptation aftereffect was obtained despite the adaptor and test stimuli being from different global categories (objects and faces respectively). These findings show that our perception of gender from faces is highly affected by our environment and recent experience. This suggests two possible mechanisms: (a) that perception of the gender associated with an object shares at least some brain areas with those responsible for gender perception of faces and (b) adaptation to gender, which is a high-level concept, can modulate brain areas that are involved in facial gender perception through top-down processes.},

Face identity aftereffects have been taken as compelling evidence in favor of a norm-based account over an exemplar-based account. After a relatively brief period of adaptation to an adaptor face, the perceived identity of a test face is shifted toward a face with attributes opposite to those of the adaptor, suggesting an explicit psychological representation of the norm. Surprisingly, despite near universal recognition that face identity aftereffects imply norm-based coding, there have been no published attempts to simulate the predictions of norm- and exemplar-based models in face adaptation paradigms. Here, we implemented and tested variations of norm and exemplar models. Contrary to common claims, our simulations revealed that both an exemplar-based model and a version of a two-pool norm-based model, but not a traditional norm-based model, predict face identity aftereffects following face adaptation.},

This expertise relies on configural coding of spatial relations between face features and/or holistic coding of overall facial structure [2–6]. These expert face-coding mechanisms appear to be engaged most effectively by upright faces, with inverted faces engaging primarily feature-coding mechanisms [2, 7–11]. We show that opposite figural aftereffects can be induced simultaneously for upright and inverted faces, demonstrating that distinct neural populations code upright and inverted faces. This result also suggests that expert (upright) face-coding mechanisms can be selectively adapted. These aftereffects occur for judgments of face normality and face gender and are robust to changes in face size, ruling out adaptation of lowlevel, retinotopically organized coding mechanisms. Our results suggest a resolution of a paradox in the face recognition literature. Neuroimaging studies have found surprisingly little orientation selectivity in the fusiform face area ({FFA}) despite evidence that this region plays a role in expert face coding [12–14] and that expert face-coding mechanisms are selectively engaged by upright faces [2, 7–11]. Our results, demonstrating orientation-contingent adaptation of facecoding mechanisms, suggest that the {FFA}’s apparent lack of orientation selectivity may be an artifact of averaging across distinct populations within the {FFA} that respond to upright and inverted faces.},

This perceptual adaptation and the resulting aftereffect reveal important characteristics regarding how perceptual systems are tuned [2, 4–6]. These aftereffects occur not only for simple stimulus features but also for high-level stimulus properties [7–10]. Here we report a novel cross-category adaptation aftereffect demonstrating that prolonged viewing of a human body without a face shifts the perceptual tuning curve for face gender and face identity. This contradicts a central assumption underlying perceptual adaptation: that adaptation depends on physical similarity between how the adapting and the adapted features are perceived [5]. Additionally, this aftereffect was not due to response bias, because its dependence on adaptation duration resembled traditional perceptual aftereffects. These body-to-face adaptation results demonstrate that bodies alone can alter the tuning properties of neurons that code for the gender and identity of faces. More generally, these results reveal that high-level perceptual adaptation can occur when the property or features being adapted are automatically inferred rather than perceived in the adapting stimulus.},

	abstract = {Background: In many animals, exaggerated sex-typical male traits are preferred by females, and may be a signal of both past and current disease resistance. The proposal that the same is true in humans – i.e., that masculine men are immunocompetent and attractive – underpins a large literature on facial masculinity preferences. Recently, theoretical models have suggested that current condition may be a better index of mate value than past immunocompetence. This is particularly likely in populations where pathogenic fluctuation is fast relative to host life history. As life history is slow in humans, there is reason to expect that, among humans, condition-dependent traits might contribute more to attractiveness than relatively stable traits such as masculinity. To date, however, there has been little rigorous assessment of whether, in the presence of variation in other cues, masculinity predicts attractiveness or not.
Methodology/Principal Findings: The relationship between masculinity and attractiveness was assessed in two samples of male faces. Most previous research has assessed masculinity either with subjective ratings or with simple anatomical measures. Here, we used geometric morphometric techniques to assess facial masculinity, generating a morphological masculinity measure based on a discriminant function that correctly classified .96\% faces as male or female. When assessed using this measure, there was no relationship between morphological masculinity and rated attractiveness. In contrast, skin colour – a fluctuating, condition-dependent cue – was a significant predictor of attractiveness.
Conclusions/Significance: These findings suggest that facial morphological masculinity may contribute less to men’s attractiveness than previously assumed. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that current condition is more relevant to male mate value than past disease resistance, and hence that temporally fluctuating traits (such as colour) contribute more to male attractiveness than stable cues of sexual dimorphism.},

Mixed results regarding facial masculinity and male attractiveness may arise partly from different inﬂuences of face shape and face colouration depending on whether colour was controlled. Recent research suggests that masculinity in face colour, namely darker skin, and femininity in shape are attractive in male faces. Here we examine the inﬂuence of sexual dimorphism in skin colour and face shape on attractiveness in 3 experiments. We allowed female participants to manipulate male and female face images along axes of sexual dimorphism in skin colour and/or shape in order to optimise attractiveness. Participants searching for the most attractive appearance chose to masculinise the colour of male faces more than the colour of female faces (although not reaching signiﬁcance in Experiment 3; p = .16). We found a clear preference for feminine shape in male faces supporting predictions of recent research. These results help to clarify the inﬂuence of facial masculinity in women’s attractiveness preferences. © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We used the same paradigm to test tilt aftereffects ({TAE}) and face gender aftereffects ({FAE}) and found that they exhibited qualitatively similar aftereffect curves, when a sufﬁciently large range of test faces was used.

	abstract = {Faces are complex visual objects, and faces chosen to vary in 1 regard may unintentionally vary in other ways, particularly if the correlation is a property of the population of faces. Here, we present an example of a correlation that arises from differences in the degree of sexual dimorphism. In Experiment 1, paired similarity ratings were collected for a set of 40 real face images chosen to vary in terms of gender and race (Asian vs. White). Multidimensional scaling ({MDS}) placed these stimuli in a “face space,” with different attributes corresponding to different dimensions. Gender was found to vary more for White faces, resulting in a negative or positive correlation between gender and race when only considering male or only considering female faces. This increased sexual dimorphism for White faces may provide an alternative explanation for differences in face processing between White and Asian faces (e.g., the own-race bias, face attractiveness biases, etc.). Studies of face processing that are unconfounded by this difference in the degree of sexual dimorphism require stimuli that are decorrelated in terms of race and gender. Decorrelated faces were created using a morphing technique, spacing the morphs uniformly around a ring in the 2-dimensional (2D) race– gender plane. In Experiment 2, paired similarity ratings confirmed the 2D positions of the morph faces. In Experiment 3, race and gender category judgments varied uniformly for these decorrelated stimuli. Our results and stimuli should prove useful for studying sexual dimorphism and for the study of face processing more generally.},

Here, we use a contingent adaptation paradigm to investigate if mechanisms for processing the gender and emotion of a face are interdependent and symmetric across the happy–angry emotional continuum and regardless of the gender of the face. We simultaneously adapted participants to angry female faces and happy male faces (Experiment 1) or to happy female faces and angry male faces (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, we found evidence for contingent adaptation, with simultaneous aftereffects in opposite directions: male faces were biased toward angry while female faces were biased toward happy. Interestingly, in the complementary Experiment 2, we did not ﬁnd evidence for contingent adaptation, with both male and female faces biased toward angry. Our results highlight that evidence for contingent adaptation and the underlying interdependent face processing mechanisms that would allow for contingent adaptation may only be evident for certain combinations of face features. Such limits may be especially important in the case of social cues given how maladaptive it may be to stop responding to threatening information, with male angry faces considered to be the most threatening. The underlying neuronal mechanisms that could account for such asymmetric effects in contingent adaptation remain to be elucidated.},

In the dual-facial condition the participants had to report both the gender and the expression of the targets. In two control conditions the participant reported either the gender or the expression of the face and indicated whether a surrounding frame was continuous or discontinuous. In Experiments 1–3, with angry and happy targets, asymmetric interference was observed. Gender discrimination, but no expression discrimination, was impaired in the dual-facial condition compared to the corresponding control. This effect was obtained with a between-subjects design in Experiment 1, with a within-subjects design in Experiment 2, and with androgynous face masks in Experiment 3. In Experiments 4a and 4b different target combinations were tested. No decrement of performance in the dual-facial task was observed for either gender or expression discrimination with fearful-disgusted (Experiment 4a) or fearfulhappy faces (Experiment 4b). We conclude that the ability to attend simultaneously to gender and expression cues without a decrement in performance depends on the specific combination of expressions to be differentiated between. Happy and angry expressions are usually directed at the perceiver and command preferential attention. Under conditions of restricted viewing such as those of the present study, discrimination of these expressions is prioritized leading to impaired discrimination of other facial properties such as gender.},

Each vector was decomposed into a sex-relevant subvector and a sex-irrelevant subvector which were, respectively, parallel and orthogonal to the main male–female axis. Principal components analysis ({PCA}) was performed on the sex-irrelevant subvectors. One principal component was negatively correlated with both perceived masculinity and femininity, and another was correlated only with femininity, though both components were orthogonal to the male–female dimension (and thus by definition sex-irrelevant).

Similarly, after prolonged exposure to a face with expanded features, faces that had previously seemed normal are more likely to be judged as having contracted features. These facial aftereffects have both been attributed to the impact of adaptation upon a norm-based opponent code, akin to low-level analyses of colour. While a good deal of evidence is consistent with this, some recent data is contradictory, motivating a more rigorous test. In behaviourally matched tasks we compared the characteristics of aftereffects generated by adapting to colour, to expanded or contracted faces, and to male or female faces. In our experiments opponent coding predicted that the appearance of the adapting image should change and that adaptation should induce symmetrical shifts of two category boundaries. This combination of predictions was ﬁrmly supported for colour adaptation, somewhat supported for facial distortion aftereffects, but not supported for facial gender aftereffects. Interestingly, the two face aftereffects we tested generated discrepant patterns of response shifts. Our data suggest that superﬁcially similar aftereffects can ensue from mechanisms that differ qualitatively, and therefore that not all high-level categorical face aftereffects can be attributed to a common coding strategy.},

We focus on social perception of faces, although the methods could be applied to other visual and nonvisual categories. We review two reverse correlation approaches: (a) psychophysical methods based on judgments of images altered with randomly generated noise, where the analysis relates the random variations of the images to judgments; and (b) methods based on judgments of randomly generated faces from a statistical, multidimensional face space model, where the analysis relates the dimensions of the face model to judgments.},

Results of Study 1 highlighted the automatic nature of categorization at an early (N170) and on a later processing stage (P300). Findings of Study 2 showed that at an early stage categorization was automatically driven by the ease of extraction of category-based knowledge from faces while, at a later stage, categorization was more influenced by situational constrains.},

Experiment 1 used image averaging and morphing techniques to demonstrate that consistent facial cues subserve a range of social inferences, even in a highly variable sample of 1000 ambient images (images that are intended to be representative of those encountered in everyday life, see Jenkins, White, Van Montfort, \& Burton, 2011). Experiment 2 then tested Oosterhof and Todorov’s two-dimensional model on this extensive sample of face images. The original two dimensions were replicated and a novel ‘youthful-attractiveness’ factor also emerged. Experiment 3 successfully cross-validated the three-dimensional model using face averages directly constructed from the factor scores. These ﬁndings highlight the utility of the original trustworthiness and dominance dimensions, but also underscore the need to utilise varied face stimuli: with a more realistically diverse set of face images, social inferences from faces show a more elaborate underlying structure than hitherto suggested.},

However, ﬁndings are mixed in regards to valence effects, that is, whether the {LPP} is larger for negative pictures than for positive pictures (negativity bias) or vice versa (positivity bias). Additionally, previous {ERP} studies have not explicitly considered a moderating effect of gender. In the present study, positive, negative, and neutral pictures were shown at ﬁxation but were always task-irrelevant. Results showed that {LPP} amplitudes for the positive and negative distracters were moderated by gender. Men showed a positivity bias on the {LPP} (i.e., larger amplitudes for positive pictures than for negative pictures). Women did not show a clear valence bias on the {LPP}, but they showed a negativity bias on picture ratings. These gender differences for the {LPP} did not habituate, as they were obtained even for pictures that were repeated 20 times. Because previous studies with other measures suggest a positivity bias for men and a negativity bias for women, the present ﬁndings extend these studies suggesting that attention allocation for emotional pictures of different valence is similarly moderated by gender.},

Recently a large number of androgynous stars appear in the media, which triggers a hot phenomenon of imitating them. Here we examine the inﬂuence of androgynous stars on people’s facial preferences for sexual dimorphism in male and female faces on different attractiveness levels using eye-tracking techniques. In male faces we found both male and female participants preferred masculine faces to androgynous faces in high attractiveness, but mixed results in low attractiveness. In female faces we found both male and female participants preferred feminine faces to androgynous faces in high attractiveness, but no preferences in low attractiveness. Results suggest that attractiveness levels of faces might be a factor causing inconsistency in sexual dimorphism preference for male faces and that androgynous faces are not preferred, which reveals that androgynous phenomenon might not be caused by facial attractiveness.},

Research testing these overgeneralization hypotheses has elucidated why we form first impressions from faces, what impressions we form, and what cues influence these impressions.

In contrast to previous ﬁndings, task-related diﬀerences were found, such that diﬀerentiation in the P2 event-related potential ({ERP}) according to perceived gender was facilitated by having an explicit task goal of categorizing faces by gender; however, the P2 was sensitive to race regardless of task goals. Use of principal components analysis ({PCA}) revealed two underlying components that comprised the P2 and that were diﬀerentially sensitive to the gender and race of the faces, depending on participants' top-down task goals. Results suggest that top-down task demands facilitate discrimination of faces along the attended dimension within {\textless} 200 ms, but that the eﬀect of top-down task demands may not be evident when examining early {ERP} components that reﬂect more than one distinct underlying process.},

Angry displays were overwhelmingly judged to be men; sad displays were judged to be women (Studies 2–4). Moreover, this pattern remained strong when stimuli were equated for velocity (Study 3).

We used a behavioral adaptation paradigm to investigate whether the previously noted perceptual similarities between trustworthiness and emotional expressions of anger and happiness extend to their underlying neural representations. We found that adapting to angry or happy facial expressions causes trustworthiness evaluations of subsequently rated neutral faces to increase or decrease, respectively. Further, we found no such modulation of trustworthiness evaluations after participants were adapted to fearful expressions, suggesting that this effect is specific to angry and happy expressions.

We asked whether the adaptation shows more transfer between faces that share a common identity, by comparing the strength of aftereffects when the adapt and test faces differed either in expression (a conﬁgural change in the same face identity) or gender (a conﬁgural change between identities). Observers adapted to expanded or contracted images of either male or female faces with either happy or fearful expressions, and then judged the perceived conﬁguration in either the same faces or faces with a different gender and/or expression. The adaptation included exposure to a single face (e.g., expanded happy) or to alternated faces where the distortion was contingent on the attribute (e.g., expanded happy versus contracted fearful). In all cases the aftereffects showed strong transfer and thus only weak selectivity. However, selectivity was equal or stronger for the change in expression than gender. Our results thus suggest that the distortion aftereffects between faces can be weakly modulated by both variant and invariant attributes of the face.},

In Study 1, brief visual exposure to highly gendered exemplars shifted perceptual norms for men’s and women’s faces. Studies 2– 4 revealed that changes in perceptual norms were accompanied by notable shifts in social evaluations. Specifically, exposure to feminine phenotypes exacerbated biases against hypermasculine faces, whereas exposure to masculine phenotypes mitigated them. These findings replicated across multiple independent samples with diverse stimulus sets and outcome measures, revealing that perceptual gender norms are calibrated on the basis of recent visual encounters, with notable implications for downstream evaluations of others.

	abstract = {The afterimage illusion refers to a complementary colored image continuing to appear in the observer’s vision after the exposure to the original image has ceased. It is assumed to be a phenomenon of the primary visual pathway, caused by overstimulation of photoreceptors of the retina. The aim of the present study was to investigate the nature of afterimage perceptions; mainly whether it is a mere physical, that is, low-level effect or whether it can be modulated by top-down processes, that is, high-level processes. Participants were first exposed to five either strongly female or male faces (Experiment 1), objects highly associated with female or male gender (Experiment 2) or female versus male names (Experiment 3), followed by a negativated image of a gender-neutral face which had to be fixated for 20 s to elicit an afterimage. Participants had to rate their afterimages according to sexual dimorphism, showing that the afterimage of the genderneutral face was perceived as significantly more female in the female priming condition compared with the male priming condition, independently of the priming quality (faces, objects, and names). Our results documented, in addition to previously presumed bottom-up mechanisms, a prominent influence of top-down processing on the perception of afterimages via priming mechanisms (female primes led to more female afterimage perception).},

	abstract = {Facial appearance can be altered, not just by restyling but also by sensory processes. Exposure to a female face can, for instance, make subsequent faces look more masculine than they would otherwise. Two explanations exist. According to one, exposure to a female face renormalizes face perception, making that female and all other faces look more masculine as a consequence—a unidirectional effect. According to that explanation, exposure to a male face would have the opposite unidirectional effect. Another suggestion is that face gender is subject to contrastive aftereffects. These should make some faces look more masculine than the adaptor and other faces more feminine—a bidirectional effect. Here, we show that face gender aftereffects are bidirectional, as predicted by the latter hypothesis. Images of real faces rated as more and less masculine than adaptors at baseline tended to look even more and less masculine than adaptors post adaptation. This suggests that, rather than mental representations of all faces being recalibrated to better reflect the prevailing statistics of the environment, mental operations exaggerate differences between successive faces, and this can impact facial gender perception.},

	abstract = {Recent research has shown that attention can inﬂuence the strength of face aftereffects. For example, attending to changes in facial features increases the strength of identity and ﬁgural aftereffects relative to passive viewing (Rhodes et al., 2011). Here, we ask whether attending to a speciﬁc social dimension of a face (such as race or gender) inﬂuences the strength of face aftereffects along that dimension. Across three experiments, participants completed many single-shot face adaptation trials. In each trial, participants observed a computer-generated adapting face for 5 s while instructed to focus on either the race or gender of that adapting face. Adapting faces were either Asian and female or Caucasian and male. In Experiment 1, all trials included an intermediate question ({IQ}) following each adaptation period, soliciting a rating of the adapting face on the attended dimension (e.g., race). In Experiment 2, only half of the trials included this {IQ}, and in Experiment 3 only a quarter of the trials did. In all three experiments, participants were subsequently presented with a race- and gender-neutral face and asked to rate it on either the attended dimension (e.g., race, attention-congruent trials) or the unattended dimension (e.g., gender, attentionincongruent trials) using a seven-point scale. Overall, participants showed signiﬁcant aftereffects in all conditions, manifesting as (i) higher Asian ratings of the neutral faces following Caucasian vs. Asian adapting faces and (ii) higher female ratings of neutral faces following male vs. female adapting faces. Intriguingly, although reaction times were shorter during attention-congruent vs. attention-incongruent trials, aftereffects were not stronger along attention-congruent than attention-incongruent dimensions. Our results suggest that attending to a facial dimension such as race or gender does not result in increased adaptation to that dimension.},

Face space models describe an abstract concept of face representations and their mental organization, in which facial representations are located on various characteristic dimensions, depending on their speciﬁc facial characteristics. However, these models are deﬁned just as incompletely as the general understanding of face recognition. We took two phenomena from face processing to better understand face recognition, and so the nature of face space: face adaptation and face priming. The face literature has mainly focused on face adaptation, largely neglecting face priming when trying to integrate outcomes regarding face recognition into the face space framework. Consequently, the present paper aims to review both phenomena and their contributions to face recognition, representation, and face space.},

It is, however, rarely deﬁned what is meant by gender. In this article, we deconstruct the concept ‘gender’ as consisting of several facets, and argue that the researcher needs to identify relevant aspects of gender in relation to their research question. We make a thorough exposition of considerations that the researcher should bear in mind when formulating questions about each facet, in order to exemplify how complex this construct is. We also remind the researcher that gender is not a binary category and discuss challenges in the balance between taking existing gender diversity into account and yet sorting participants into gender categorisations that function in statistical analyzes. To aid in this process, we provide an empirical example on how gender identity may be categorised when using a free-text response. Lastly, we suggest that other measurements than participants’ gender might be better predictors of the outcome variable.},

Previous research has examined gender-inclusive language use regarding cisgender men and women, but little work has focused on genderinclusive language use regarding {TGNC} individuals. Two studies explored the connections between attitudes toward transgender individuals and perceptions of {TGNC}-inclusive language. Three hierarchical linear regressions and a mini metaanalysis were conducted.

In this article, I show through simulation that the interpretation of Bayesian quantities does not depend on the stopping rule. Researchers using Bayesian methods may employ optional stopping in their own research and may provide Bayesian analysis of secondary data regardless of the employed stopping rule. I emphasize here the proper interpretation of Bayesian quantities as measures of subjective belief on theoretical positions, the difference between frequentist and Bayesian interpretations, and the difficulty of using frequentist intuition to conceptualize the Bayesian approach.},

Traditionally, the development and validation of these measures has been guided by classical test theory. However, item response theory ({IRT}), an alternate measurement framework, offers promise for addressing practical measurement problems found in health-related research that have been difficult to solve through classical methods. This paper introduces foundational concepts in {IRT}, as well as commonly used models and their assumptions. Existing data on a combined sample (n = 636) of Korean American and Vietnamese American adults who responded to the High Blood Pressure Health Literacy Scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 are used to exemplify typical applications of {IRT}. These examples illustrate how {IRT} can be used to improve the development, refinement, and evaluation of {PRO} measures. Greater use of methods based on this framework can increase the accuracy and efficiency with which {PROs} are measured.},

Several response distributions are supported, of which all parameters (e.g., location, scale, and shape) can be predicted at the same time thus allowing for distributional regression. Non-linear relationships may be speciﬁed using non-linear predictor terms or semi-parametric approaches such as splines or Gaussian processes. To make all of these modeling options possible in a multilevel framework, brms provides an intuitive and powerful formula syntax, which extends the well known formula syntax of lme4. The purpose of the present paper is to introduce this syntax in detail and to demonstrate its usefulness with four examples, each showing other relevant aspects of the syntax.},

Here we lay out fast and stable computations for {LOO} and {WAIC} that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an eﬃcient computation of {LOO} using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling ({PSIS}), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although {WAIC} is asymptotically equal to {LOO}, we demonstrate that {PSIS}-{LOO} is more robust in the ﬁnite case with weak priors or inﬂuential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models ﬁt with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

	abstract = {Item Response Theory ({IRT}) is widely applied in the human sciences to model persons’ responses on a set of items measuring one or more latent constructs. While several R packages have been developed that implement {IRT} models, they tend to be restricted to respective prespeciﬁed classes of models. Further, most implementations are frequentist while the availability of Bayesian methods remains comparably limited. I demonstrate how to use the R package brms together with the probabilistic programming language Stan to specify and ﬁt a wide range of Bayesian {IRT} models using ﬂexible and intuitive multilevel formula syntax. Further, item and person parameters can be related in both a linear or non-linear manner. Various distributions for categorical, ordinal, and continuous responses are supported. Users may even deﬁne their own custom response distribution for use in the presented framework. Common {IRT} model classes that can be speciﬁed natively in the presented framework include 1PL and 2PL logistic models optionally also containing guessing parameters, graded response and partial credit ordinal models, as well as drift diﬀusion models of response times coupled with binary decisions. Posterior distributions of item and person parameters can be conveniently extracted and postprocessed. Model ﬁt can be evaluated and compared using Bayes factors and eﬃcient cross-validation procedures.},

Race-contingent aftereffects reﬂect perceptions of typicality, indicating a gradual transition of activity across channels as faces change from looking more typical of one race to the other We examine whether faces forming more discrete categories (sex: male/ female; species: human/monkey) are encoded in a similar fashion, or whether they are instead encoded via more dichotomous categorical judgements. Curves representing the rate of change of aftereffect magnitude as stimuli changed from male to female produced shallow slopes, closely resembling ratings of typicality, but differing signiﬁcantly from slopes for categorical judgements. For species, aftereffect slopes were signiﬁcantly shallower than both ratings of typicality and categorical judgements. Overall, these results suggest that the encoding of facial properties such as these is not categorical, but instead involves a graded response as stimulus typicality varies. Aftereffect slopes were similar across the two experiments, raising the possibility of a common system that is recruited during contingent adaptation, regardless of the speciﬁc dimension involved or the categories used by the experimenter.},

According to this criterion, if a high-level property (for example, an emotional expression) is susceptible to after-effects, this suggests that the property can be perceived, rather than cognized. The defenders of the criterion claim that, since after-effects are also present for low-level, uncontroversially perceptual properties (such as orientation), we can safely infer that high-level aftereffects are perceptual as well. The critics of the criterion, on the other hand, assimilate it to superficially similar effects in cognition (such as decision biases) and argue that the after-effect criterion is a cognitive phenomenon rather than a perceptual one, and that as a result it is not a reliable guide for exploring the contents of perception. I argue against both of these views and show that high-level after-effects cannot be identified either with low-level after-effects or with cognitive biases. I suggest an intermediate position: high-level after-effects are not cognitive, but they are nonetheless not a good criterion for exploring the contents of perception.},

	abstract = {Facial appearance can be altered, not just by restyling but also by sensory processes. Exposure to a female face can, for instance, make subsequent faces look more masculine than they would otherwise. Two explanations exist. According to one, exposure to a female face renormalizes face perception, making that female and all other faces look more masculine as a consequence—a unidirectional effect. According to that explanation, exposure to a male face would have the opposite unidirectional effect. Another suggestion is that face gender is subject to contrastive aftereffects. These should make some faces look more masculine than the adaptor and other faces more feminine—a bidirectional effect. Here, we show that face gender aftereffects are bidirectional, as predicted by the latter hypothesis. Images of real faces rated as more and less masculine than adaptors at baseline tended to look even more and less masculine than adaptors post adaptation. This suggests that, rather than mental representations of all faces being recalibrated to better reflect the prevailing statistics of the environment, mental operations exaggerate differences between successive faces, and this can impact facial gender perception.},

Statistical analysis demonstrates that tú is reserved for a few specific situations, and may represent an intermediate level of formality between usted and vos. Tú is reported more frequently by older and moderately educated speakers. Vos, however, is being advanced by younger, welleducated speakers in both frequency and into pragmatic areas that previously belonged to usted.

Although a number of studies have used words as contextual cues for emotion processing, the role of what is being labeled by the words (i.e., one’s own emotion as compared to the emotion expressed by the sender) is poorly understood. The present study reports results from two experiments which used {ERP} methodology to evaluate the impact of emotional faces and self- vs. sender-related emotional pronoun-noun pairs (e.g., my fear vs. his fear) as cues for emotional face processing. The inﬂuence of self- and sender-related cues on the processing of fearful, angry and happy faces was investigated in two contexts: an automatic (experiment 1) and intentional affect labeling task (experiment 2), along with control conditions of passive face processing. {ERP} patterns varied as a function of the label’s reference (self vs. sender) and the intentionality of the labeling task (experiment 1 vs. experiment 2). In experiment 1, self-related labels increased the motivational relevance of the emotional faces in the time-window of the {EPN} component. Processing of sender-related labels improved emotion recognition speciﬁcally for fearful faces in the N170 time-window. Spontaneous processing of affective labels modulated later stages of face processing as well. Amplitudes of the late positive potential ({LPP}) were reduced for fearful, happy, and angry faces relative to the control condition of passive viewing. During intentional regulation (experiment 2) amplitudes of the {LPP} were enhanced for emotional faces when subjects used the self-related emotion labels to label their own emotion during face processing, and they rated the faces as higher in arousal than the emotional faces that had been presented in the “label sender’s emotion” condition or the passive viewing condition. The present results argue in favor of a differentiated view of language-as-context for emotion processing.},

In Experiment 1, four-person groups worked on a decision-making task with randomly assigned leadership status. In Studies 2 and 3, two-person groups either worked on a task or chatted informally in a get-to-know-you session. Study 4 was a naturalistic study of incoming and outgoing e-mail of 9 participants who provided information on their correspondents’ relative status. The last study examined 40 letters written by soldiers in the regime of Saddam Hussein. Computerized text analyses across the five studies found that people with higher status consistently used fewer first-person singular, and more first-person plural and second-person singular pronouns. Natural language use during group interaction suggests that status is associated with attentional biases, such that higher rank is linked with other-focus whereas lower rank is linked with self-focus.},

Two principle strategies have been employed to make languages gender-fair and to treat women and men symmetrically: neutralization and feminization. Neutralization is achieved, for example, by replacing male-masculine forms (policeman) with genderunmarked forms (police ofﬁcer), whereas feminization relies on the use of feminine forms to make female referents visible (i.e., the applicant... he or she instead of the applicant... he). By integrating research on (1) language structures, (2) language policies, and (3) individual language behavior, we provide a critical review of how {GFL} contributes to the reduction of gender stereotyping and discrimination. Our review provides a basis for future research and for scientiﬁcally based policy-making.},

Four hundred and ten transgender individuals (M ϭ 30.27 years, 83.9\% European American) participated in a survey in which they reported how frequently they are misgendered and how stigmatized they feel when it occurs in addition to protective factors (gender identity importance, social support) and psychological distress (anxiety, depression, stress, transgender felt stigma). On average, participants reported being misgendered sometimes (M ϭ 3.05, {SD} ϭ 1.18) and feeling somewhat stigmatized by these experiences (M ϭ 3.64, {SD} ϭ 1.30). Perceived frequency of misgendering and feeling stigmatized by these experiences were positively associated with identity importance, but only perceived frequency was negatively associated with social support. Both perceived frequency and feeling stigmatized were positively associated with psychological distress. In turn, identity importance and social support were positively associated with psychological distress. There was a significant interaction between felt stigma and identity importance in predicting depression and stress. There was a positive association between felt stigma and stress and depression at low and high levels of identity importance, but this association was stronger at low levels of identity importance. In addition, there was a significant interaction between perceived frequency of misgendering and social support such that the association between perceived frequency and felt stigma was positive at low levels of social support but not at high levels of social support. In conclusion, misgendering is likely a novel minority stressor for transgender people.},

The 3 phases of the first model included a pretransition phase, during the transition phase, and posttransition phase. Within these 3 phases, the following 5 major themes emerged: preparation for the work transition, coming out at work, presentation and appearance at work, others’ reactions at work, and affective/coping experiences related to work.

Therefore is generic information more prominent in unfamiliar versus familiar face processing? In order to address the question we tapped into two relatively disparate stages of face processing. At the early stages of encoding, we employed perceptual masking to reveal that only perception of unfamiliar face targets is affected by the gender of the facial masks. At the semantic end; using a priming paradigm, we found that while to-beignored unfamiliar faces prime lexical decisions to gender congruent stereotypic words, familiar faces do not. Our findings indicate that gender is a more salient dimension in unfamiliar relative to familiar face processing, both in early perceptual stages as well as later semantic stages of person construal.},

Using a standard priming paradigm to index the products of person construal (i.e., categorical and stereotype- based knowledge), the results of three experiments revealed that: (i) hair cues alone are sufficient to trigger category and stereotype activation; and (ii) during the early stages of person perception, these cues have the capacity to reverse conventional priming effects and generate errors of categorical assignment (e.g., female faces prime male knowledge). These findings are considered in the context of contemporary accounts of person construal. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The masculinity hypothesis proposes that conformity to masculine gender roles including dominance, confidence, sexual success, and physical and emotional self-control places men at risk for muscularity-oriented body dissatisfaction and disordered eating. However, despite some empirical support for this hypothesis, several gaps in the literature remain. The present study was the first to use multidimensional instruments of gender role conformity to investigate whether masculinity and femininity are associated with male body dissatisfaction and disordered eating. Participants were 246 young heterosexual men who completed an online survey that asked questions about muscle dissatisfaction, body fat dissatisfaction, thinness- and muscularity-oriented disordered eating. Results from 4 simultaneous multiple regressions showed that increased conformity to masculine norms predicted greater muscle dissatisfaction and muscularity-oriented disordered eating, but not body fat dissatisfaction or thinness-oriented disordered eating. Conformity to feminine norms predicted greater muscle dissatisfaction, thinness- and muscularity-oriented disordered eating. The results provide support for the masculinity hypothesis and extend it to include muscularity-oriented disordered eating. Furthermore, the results suggest that the femininity hypothesis, which proposes that feminine norm endorsement is a risk factor for body dissatisfaction and disordered eating in women, may also generalize to men. Clinicians should consider integrating gendered perspectives into treatments for men with eating disorders. Future research into the mechanisms through which gender role conformity influences body image and eating outcomes in males is necessary.},

We used Blaubergs’ (1980) and Parks and Roberton’s (1998) taxonomies of critical arguments against past gender-fair language reforms in English in the 1970s and 1990s as a basis for coding the arguments. A majority of arguments (80.7\%) could be coded into existing categories, indicating that criticisms of gender-fair language initiatives are similar across different times and cultural contexts. Two categories of arguments did not fit existing categories (19.3\%): gender-neutral pronouns are distracting in communication and gender information is important in communication. Furthermore, we established four overarching dimensions that capture assumptions and beliefs underlying gender-fair language criticism: (a) Defending the Linguistic Status Quo (39.4\%), (b) Sexism and Cisgenderism (27.4\%), (c) Diminishing the Issue and Its Proponents (26.9\%), and (d) Distractor In Communication (6.3\%). These dimensions of criticisms should be considered and addressed in different ways when implementing gender-fair language.},

Depending on the studies, the egalitarian norm was experimentally manipulated or induced and kept constant. Group distinctiveness was manipulated through scientific support for the theory that a person’s sexual orientation is determined by biological factors in terms of the extant biological differences (high distinctiveness) versus biological similarities (low distinctiveness) between heterosexual and gay people. Egalitarian norms increased men’s (but not women’s) intergroup differentiation (Study 1) and prejudice (Study 2) when group distinctiveness was low (as compared to high). This pattern was specific to men with high gender self-esteem, and appeared when the biological theory was framed in terms of intergroup differences rather than the uncontrollability of sexual orientation (Study 3).},

The first idea is that the adoption of a low alpha level (e.g., 5\%) puts reasonable bounds on the rate at which errors can enter the published literature, making false-positive effects rare enough to be considered a minor issue. This, we point out, rests on statistical misunderstanding: The alpha level imposes no limit on the rate at which errors may arise in the literature (Ioannidis, 2005b). Second, some argue that whereas direct replication attempts are uncommon, conceptual replication attempts are common—providing an even better test of the validity of a phenomenon. We contend that performing conceptual rather than direct replication attempts interacts insidiously with publication bias, opening the door to literatures that appear to confirm the reality of phenomena that in fact do not exist. Finally, we discuss the argument that errors will eventually be pruned out of the literature if the field would just show a bit of patience. We contend that there are no plausible concrete scenarios to back up such forecasts and that what is needed is not patience, but rather systematic reforms in scientific practice.},

These questions have been traditionally addressed by null hypothesis significance testing ({NHST}). {NHST} has deep problems that are solved by Bayesian data analysis. As psychologists transition to Bayesian data analysis, it is natural to ask how Bayesian analysis assesses null values. The article explains and evaluates two different Bayesian approaches. One method involves Bayesian model comparison (and uses Bayes factors). The second method involves Bayesian parameter estimation and assesses whether the null value falls among the most credible values. Which method to use depends on the specific question that the analyst wants to answer, but typically the estimation approach (not using Bayes factors) provides richer information than the model comparison approach.},

Study 1 demonstrates that increased exposure to racial ambiguity across 2 weeks reduced White individuals’ biological lay theories. Study 2 shows that Whites who interacted in a laboratory setting with a racially ambiguous individual were less likely to endorse biological lay theories, an effect that sustained for 2 weeks. Study 3 finds that the reduction in biological lay theories after exposure to racial ambiguity is mediated by the tendency for Whites’ lay theories of race to conform to beliefs they presume racially ambiguous individuals hold.},

(1) Are genderidentity variants to be understood as psychopathology or natural variation? (2) Is gender (and perhaps even sex) better conceptualized as binary or non-binary? The answer depends on the conceptual context and related considerations of utility. In the context of evolutionary biology, marked variants of sex and gender decrease reproductive success and are, thereby, deemed pathologic. In the present era of the anthropocene, however, the material conditions underlying the traditional division of labor between the sexes and the role of reproductive success have dramatically changed. These changes decrease the psychosocial importance of the binary gender distinction, provide more freedom for non-binary gender expression and identity formation, and render the distinction of pathologic and non-pathologic less useful, unless gender dysphoria develops secondary to a psychiatric condition. Although most people state their gender identity in the form of a nominal category, most self-report or interview-based ratings and multi-item scales of gender expression and/or identity show continuous distributions, either unimodal-asymmetric or bimodal, depending on whether they are designed for one or both of the traditional genders. Similarly, the rating scales of androgen-influenced variants of the genitalia—usually designed for one of the traditional sexes—typically represent a unipolar-asymmetric continuum. However, the binary gender system remains the primary framework against which individuals evaluate themselves. For those who develop gender dysphoria, assistance by mental-health service providers continues to be important.},

For this, the authors analyze newspaper coverage of sexuality concepts in the United Kingdom from 1995 to 2010 and quantify if and how tolerance toward ambiguous concepts including “bisexuality” vary across time as well as with gender, political opinion, and expertise. Our findings indicate a distinct “millennial effect” of intolerance toward sexual ambiguity, suggesting that resistance against ambiguity rears up during periods of instability. Conversely, we found higher levels of ambiguity tolerance in left-wing newspapers, broadsheet publications, female journalists, and expert writers, as opposed to rightwing newspapers, tabloid publications, male journalists, and novice writers. Our results can help to better understand to what degree concepts related to human sexuality are relatively hard-wired or rather fluid social categories.},

An online questionnaire measured 306 participants’ negative attitudes toward bisexual men and bisexuality. Results indicated that levels of bisexual discrimination for most participants were inﬂuenced by altering the content of an article that participants read before completing a measure of bisexual discrimination. Biphobia scores remained relatively stable among bisexual participants regardless of gender, whereas scores were revealed to be more variable among straight participants. By illustrating the contrasting ways in which individuals perceive information about bisexual people, the ﬁndings of this study suggest a new understanding of bisexual discrimination that differs from the existing literature.},

	abstract = {Many studies of anti-transء prejudice have measured such attitudes using the Genderism and Transphobia Scale ({GTS}; Hill \& Willoughby, 2005). The {GTS} is unique in assessing negative attitudes and propensity for violence toward transء people. The present research addressed previously observed limitations in the psychometric properties of data produced by the {GTS}, including inconsistencies in factor structure and subscale scoring across studies. Results across the present 2 studies (Ns ϭ 314 and 250) yielded 2 refined versions of the {GTS}: the 22-item {GTS}–Revised ({GTS}-R) and a more abbreviated 13-item {GTS}-R–Short Form ({GTS}-R-{SF}), each of which produced stable 2-factor structures corresponding with the intended negative attitudes and propensity for violence dimensions of the {GTS}. The 2 versions differ in that the {GTS}-R-{SF} Genderism/Transphobia subscale focuses on more severe expressions of prejudicial attitudes, whereas the longer {GTS}-R Genderism/Transphobia subscale assesses subtle expressions of prejudice as well. The Gender-Bashing subscale is identical across the 2 versions. Thus, researchers and practitioners may choose the {GTS}-R or {GTS}-R-{SF} depending on the breadth of prejudicial attitudes they wish to assess. Reliability estimates for {GTS}-R and {GTS}-R-{SF} scale and subscale item responses were acceptable and stable across the 2 studies, and validity evidence was garnered in Study 2. These findings can inform use of the {GTS}-R and {GTS}-R-{SF} in research and practice settings, where psychometric precision and efficiency are both critical.},

The present study of undergraduates (N = 110) built on previous research by exploring the role of interpersonal contact, acceptance of stereotyping, traditional gender roles, causal attribution, religiosity, and gender in attitudes toward transgender persons. As hypothesized, one-way {ANOVA} and multiple regression indicated that interpersonal contact with transgender individuals and attributing transgender orientation to biological factors predicted lower levels of genderism/transphobia; whereas greater acceptance of stereotyping, endorsement of traditional gender roles, and greater religiosity predicted higher levels of genderism/transphobia. Men reported higher genderism/transphobia scores than women. Findings provided insight into how attitudes toward transgender individuals may be conceptualized and shaped by social and cognitive processes.

We also assessed the range of research topics that have used a {GST} framework. We found that 34 years later, {GST} continues to be cited frequently, with a broad reach beyond U.S. psychology, particularly into international as well as communication and business journals. We found five primary novel uses of the theory: development, discrimination/stereotyping, occupations, historically marginalized populations, and mental health and trauma. We conclude that {GST} has been a generative theory. For the future, we recommend that {GST} be used to frame the study of intersectionality, for research-based activism, and as part of a project of theory-bridging.},

	abstract = {Categorizing racially ambiguous individuals is multifaceted, and the current work proposes social-motivational factors also exert considerable influence on how racial ambiguity is perceived, directing the resolution of ambiguity in a manner that is functionally beneficial to the perceiver. Four studies tested two motivations related to social belonging: belonging needs and racial identification. Greater need to belong and racial identification (Study 1), and two types of social belonging threats—social exclusion (Studies 2a and 2b) and racial identity threat (Study 3)—predicted more categorizations of racially ambiguous Black/White faces as Black, with White participants more likely to categorize ambiguous faces as outgroup members (i.e., Black; Studies 1, 2a, 2b, and 3) and Black participants more likely to categorize ambiguous faces as ingroup members (Study 2b). Results also demonstrated that self-affirmation mitigated this motivated categorization for Whites (Study 3), illustrating the malleability of social categorization and its dependency on serving self-relevant goals.},

Empirical studies on perception and theoretical models of semantic cognition show that sensory input is ﬁltered and interpreted based on predictions from higher order cognitive areas. Here, we review the present evidence to the proposal that linguistic constructs, in particular, words, could serve as effective priors, facilitating perception and integration of sensory information. We address a number of theoretical questions arising from this assumption. The focus here is if linguistic categories have a direct top-down effect on early stages of perception; or rather interact with later processing stages such as semantic analysis. We discuss experimental approaches that could discriminate between these possibilities. Taken together, this article provides a review on the interaction between language and perception from the predictive perspective, and suggests avenues to investigate the underlying mechanisms from this perspective.},

Fortunately, there is a clear solution: conduct studies with greater statistical power.},

	abstract = {Language is assumed to augment human cognition. But can language also affect basic mechanisms of perception, suggesting cognitive penetrability of perception? This idea is highly controversial: linguistic categorization may induce top-down effects on ongoing perceptual processing. Alternatively, such effects may not concern perception proper, but pre-perceptual shifts of attention or downstream processes, such as perceptual judgment. This study provides a critical test of these views by investigating categorical perception ({CP}) of novel objects in a balanced learning design, controlling for perceptual experience and low-level visual differences. To better understand which linguistic representations induce {CP}, we manipulated the type of information categories were based on: bare verbal labels, in-depth semantic knowledge, or the combined information from labels associated with semantic knowledge. We used event-related brain potentials ({ERPs}) derived from the {EEG} in a visual search task to localize {CP} effects at perceptual or pre/post-perceptual stages. The results replicated behavioral {CP} with facilitated visual search when target and distractors belonged to different linguistic categories. {ERPs} revealed {CP} effects in the P1 and N1 components, associated with early visual processing. Attentional selection, reflected in the N2, also was influenced by linguistic categories. The N2 and the N400, a measure of high-level semantic processing, were sensitive to the depth of semantic knowledge associated with objects. {CP}, however, did not differ between category types, suggesting that any linguistic categorization can lead to {CP}. The findings support cognitive penetrability of perception, with linguistic categories informing perceptual predictions down to the processing of low-level visual features.},

In addition to such actuarial summaries, we hypothesize that observers also extract social information about groups that may influence downstream judgments and behavior. In four studies, we first show that humans quickly and accurately perceive the sex ratio of a group after only 500 ms of visual exposure. We then test whether these percepts bias judgments about the group’s social attitudes and affect the perceiver’s sense of belonging. As the ratio of men to women increased, both male and female perceivers judged the group to harbor more sexist norms, and judgments of belonging changed concomitantly, albeit in opposite directions for men and women. Thus, observers judge a group’s sex ratio from a mere glimpse and use it to infer social attitudes and interpersonal affordances. We discuss the implication of these findings for a heretofore overlooked hurtle facing women in male-dominated fields (e.g., science, technology, engineering, or mathematics): how the ratio of men to women provides an early visible cue that signals an individual’s potential fit.},

We also investigate facial features that are crucial for this ability. Across 6 pre-registered studies (n = 461) we present novel evidence that 1) people can extract gender and race from brief displays of up to 14 faces (performance for race is better than gender estimation, approaching that in dot estimation); 2) only the encoding of gender is affected when hair is removed from faces, while the encoding of both gender and race is disrupted when luminance levels of the faces are equalized; and 3) this ability is disrupted by inversion when hair has been removed and luminance has been controlled but not when the stimuli are uncontrolled. This research investigates people's social category enumeration abilities with manipulations and nonsocial stimuli comparisons, and has implications for person perception and prejudice formation.},

Here we investigated how well we remember personally familiar faces in terms of their identity, gender, and race. In three experiments, based on the faces personally familiar to our participants, we created sets of face morphs that parametrically varied the faces in terms of identity, sex or race, using a 3-dimensional morphable face model. For each familiar face, we presented those face morphs together with the original face and asked participants to pick the correct “real” face among morph distracters in each set. They were instructed to pick the face that most closely resembled their memory of that familiar person. We found that participants excelled in retrieving the correct familiar faces among the distracters when the faces were manipulated in terms of their idiosyncratic features (their identity information), but they were less sensitive to changes that occurred along the gender and race continuum. Image similarity analyses indicate that the observed difference cannot be attributed to different levels of image similarity between manipulations. These findings demonstrate that idiosyncratic and categorical face information is represented differently in memory, even for the faces of people we are very familiar with. Implications to current models of face recognition are discussed.},

The surveys comprised measures of attitudes toward, and use of, hen as well as possible predictors such as area of residence, age, preferred pronoun, political orientation, and interest in gender issues. Results showed that attitudes toward hen became more positive and that use of hen increased between 2015 and 2018. About half of the population used hen in their communication in 2018, which is a 14-percentage-point increase from 2015. Younger age, she or hen as preferred pronoun, political left-wing orientation, and interest in gender issues predicted a more positive attitude and a more frequent use. Furthermore, the positive change between 2015 and 2018 was larger among younger people, indicating that hen will remain in the Swedish language. The present research is unique in that it follows a gender-fair language initiative during its implementation in representative samples, thereby providing insights for social movements aiming for gender-fair language.

Here we draw attention to the Savage–Dickey density ratio method, a method that can be used to compute the result of a Bayesian hypothesis test for nested models and under certain plausible restrictions on the parameter priors. Practical examples demonstrate the method’s validity, generality, and ﬂexibility.},

A wide range of distributions and link functions are supported, allowing users to fit – among others – linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, hurdle, and even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include both theory-driven and data-driven non-linear terms, auto-correlation structures, censoring and truncation, meta-analytic standard errors, and quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the response distribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional regression. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their prior knowledge. Models can easily be evaluated and compared using several methods assessing posterior or prior predictions.

Experts, perspectives demonstrated strong thematic commonalities across quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods domains in terms of pedagogy, by connecting learners to research, giving direct and immersive experiences of research practice and promoting reflexivity.

The second part of the paper provides an overview of the policy activity and pedagogic solutions presented in response to the context introduced in the first part. This section explains how the practice of research method teaching is changing and accounts for the trends of using pedagogies informed by constructivist learning theory and embedding methods in the substantive curriculum. The third section identifies three critical debates emanating from the two previous sections. First an appraisal of applicability of constructivist pedagogies, second the case for holistic curriculum design across a whole degree programme, and third, an analysis of the relevancy of efforts to strengthen the nexus between research and teaching.},

One way of addressing these issues is to enable students to participate in a 'real' research project, often commissioned by an external agency. Reports of this approach have demonstrated its benefits to student learning and have identified some logistical problems of project-based teaching. This paper reports on a project-based research methods course which has been running for 5 years and which has some distinctive features: unlike most such courses it is compulsory and is taken by a relatively large number of students; the research project is funded each year by a commissioning agency; coruiderable emphasis is placed upon the assessment of students' contributions to the research. These distinctive aspects of the course are discussed in relation to one particular project in which students participated, a patient satisfaction study of an accident and emergency department, funded by a Regional Health Authority. The results of a student evaluation of the learning benefits of involvement in this project are reported. It is concluded that project-based learning of research methods on courses that are larger than those reported in the literature and which are compulsory can be beneficial to both students and commissioners, and that through detailed planning of student participation and formal assessment of students" research activities, some of the problems reported by those running such courses can be resolved.},

	abstract = {Imagined intergroup contact (Crisp \& Turner, 2009) is a new indirect contact strategy for promoting tolerance and more positive intergroup relations. Despite its relatively recent inception, there have now been over 70 studies showing that imagining a positive interaction with an outgroup member can reduce prejudice and encourage positive intergroup behavior. With this meta-analysis, we provide the first quantitative review of imagined contact effects on four key measures of intergroup bias: attitudes, emotions, intentions, and behavior. We also test for moderators arising from both group and study design characteristics. The analysis found that imagined contact resulted in significantly reduced intergroup bias across all four dependent variables (overall d+ = 0.35). The effect was significant for both published and unpublished studies, and emerged across a broad range of target outgroups and contexts. The effect was equally strong for explicit and implicit attitude measures, but was stronger on behavioral intentions than on attitudes, supporting the direct link between imagery and action proposedly underlying mental simulation effects. Most design characteristics had no significant impact, including valence of the imagined interaction, type of control condition, and time spent imagining contact. However, the more participants were instructed to elaborate on the context within which the imagined interaction took place, the stronger the effect. The imagined contact effect was also stronger for children than for adults, supporting the proposition that imagined contact is a potentially key component of educational strategies aiming to promote positive social change.},

The lack of explicit and shared pedagogy in this area make it particularly important that research is conducted to stimulate pedagogic culture, dialogue and development. The authors discuss the range of methods used in one study with the aim of teasing out pedagogical content knowledge, making implicit pedagogic knowledge more explicit and thereby malleable. The research design and methods deliberately foster dialogue with, rather than cast a judgmental gaze upon, teachers and learners of research methods. Rejecting observational methods on this basis, and declining action research because of the level of participant pedagogic knowledge and commitment required, the authors examine a combination of expert panel, video stimulated dialogue and diary methods for building pedagogic knowledge and culture. These ‘methods that teach’ are argued to offer value for other researchers working in new and emerging teaching fields, where pedagogy is particularly ‘hard to know’ and pedagogic content knowledge and pedagogic culture are underexplored or underdeveloped.},

It tells the story of the creation and use of a short pedagogical comic. We begin with a brief review of the literature around the use of comics in teaching. Then we offer two first-person accounts. Independent researcher Helen Kara narrates her creation of Conversation with a Purpose, designed as a resource to support the teaching of qualitative interviewing. It contains the story of a student’s first real-world interview, with some deliberately ambiguous aspects, and some discussion questions. Then Jenni Brooks, a senior lecturer in sociology at Sheffield Hallam University, outlines her use of the comic in teaching undergraduate sociology students. Each author offers a brief reflection on her experience. We conclude that the use of comics has the potential to bridge the gap between classroom and practice for inexperienced qualitative researchers, and we encourage further research in this area.},

Students enjoy active learning opportunities like hands-on demonstrations, authentic research participation, and working with real data.

In this study, we developed a workshop activity in which students participated in a computer-based experiment and used class-generated data to run a range of statistical procedures. To enable evaluation, we developed a parallel, didactic/canned workshop, which was identical to the activity-based version, except that students were told about the experiment and used a pre-existing/canned dataset to perform their analyses. Tutorial groups were randomized to one of the two workshop versions, and 39 students completed a post-workshop evaluation questionnaire. A series of generalized linear mixed models suggested that, compared to the students in the didactic/canned condition, students exposed to the activity-based workshop displayed signiﬁcantly greater knowledge of the methodological and statistical issues addressed in class, and were more conﬁdent about their ability to use this knowledge in the future. However, overall evaluations and satisfaction between the two groups were not reliably different. Implications of these ﬁndings and suggestions for future research are discussed.},

Whilst a number of studies have sought to investigate and address the barriers to its effective teaching, few have taken a quantitative approach and fewer still a longitudinal design in order to examine the efficacy of specified interventions. This study employed such a design, the sample consisting of three cohorts of first–year psychology students (N=286) over three consecutive years who were undertaking Research Methods as a compulsory module. Changes were implemented in both the delivery and assessment regime to facilitate a more engaging delivery of the material and greater consolidation of basic principles though iterative classroom techniques and the use of formative and summative assessments. A significant improvement in student marks, despite an increase in the difficulty of the assessments, was found with overall marks increasing by a whole grade band. Further analysis of the different assessed elements of the yearlong module also demonstrated improved performance in each of the constituent parts. This study, therefore, extends the growing body of evidence–based literature on the use of effective teaching techniques and assessment regimes in a challenging area.},

If the teaching of methods in any scientific discipline fails to exemplify this common feature, then the enterprise of science may be subverted. This could happen, for example, if a hypothesis fundamental to some method were not taught critically or, more seriously, if critical scrutiny of it were to be systematically excluded from the curriculum. It is argued here that this has happened in psychometrics with regard to the claim upon which psychological measurement depends, namely, that psychological attributes (e.g., intellectual abilities, personality traits, and social attitudes) are quantitative. It is further argued that this has happened because of historical and social pressures within the discipline. Suggestions are made for additions to the measurement curriculum.},

In addition, all measures related to course performance, such that students who showed lower levels of paranormal beliefs and greater general critical thinking abilities at the outset of the course earned more total points.

With this meta-analysis, we provide the first quantitative review of imagined contact effects on four key measures of intergroup bias: attitudes, emotions, intentions, and behavior. We also test for moderators arising from both group and study design characteristics. The analysis found that imagined contact resulted in significantly reduced intergroup bias across all four dependent variables (overall d+ = 0.35). The effect was significant for both published and unpublished studies, and emerged across a broad range of target outgroups and contexts. The effect was equally strong for explicit and implicit attitude measures, but was stronger on behavioral intentions than on attitudes, supporting the direct link between imagery and action proposedly underlying mental simulation effects. Most design characteristics had no significant impact, including valence of the imagined interaction, type of control condition, and time spent imagining contact. However, the more participants were instructed to elaborate on the context within which the imagined interaction took place, the stronger the effect. The imagined contact effect was also stronger for children than for adults, supporting the proposition that imagined contact is a potentially key component of educational strategies aiming to promote positive social change.},

The present study followed the implementation of a gender-inclusive third-person pronoun singular (hen) in Swedish in two surveys with representative samples in 2015 (at the time when hen was introduced in the official Swedish dictionary; N = 1212) and in 2018 (N = 2009). The surveys comprised measures of attitudes toward, and use of, hen as well as possible predictors such as area of residence, age, preferred pronoun, political orientation, and interest in gender issues. Results showed that attitudes toward hen became more positive and that use of hen increased between 2015 and 2018. About half of the population used hen in their communication in 2018, which is a 14-percentage-point increase from 2015. Younger age, she or hen as preferred pronoun, political left-wing orientation, and interest in gender issues predicted a more positive attitude and a more frequent use. Furthermore, the positive change between 2015 and 2018 was larger among younger people, indicating that hen will remain in the Swedish language. The present research is unique in that it follows a gender-fair language initiative during its implementation in representative samples, thereby providing insights for social movements aiming for gender-fair language. We also discuss the theoretical implications of a gender-inclusive pronoun in comparison with past studies on gender-fair language.},

	abstract = {Background  There is a growing recognition that sex characteristics and gender-related aspects can have a substantial impact on the health-related quality of life ({HRQoL}) of persons with Parkinson’s disease ({PD}). Gender is a multidimensional construct, including dynamic social norms and relations that influence health and impact quality of life. Even when gender is investigated in the field of {PD}, it is frequently conceptualized as gender identity while other dimensions, such as roles or relations, are generally ignored. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of several gender dimensions on {HRQoL} among people with {PD}.
Methods  We performed a survey-based, cross-sectional study in the Netherlands to explore the impact of several gender dimensions, namely; gender identity, gender roles and gender relations on {HRQoL} ({PDQ}-39) of people with {PD}.
Results  In our study population (N = 307), including 127 (41\%) women, we did not observe an association between gender identity and overall {HRQoL}. In contrast, an androgynous gender role and higher engagement in household tasks were associated with better overall {HRQoL} among people with {PD}.
Conclusions  This study offers the first detailed description of the impact of different gender dimensions on the {HRQoL} of people with {PD} and highlights the need for more precise gender-measures to inform actionable gender-sensitive health interventions for people with {PD}.},

              Background
              Public safety personnel ({PSP}; e.g., border services personnel, correctional workers, firefighters, paramedics, police, public safety communicators) are frequently exposed to potentially psychologically traumatic events. Such events contribute to substantial and growing challenges from posttraumatic stress injuries ({PTSIs}), including but not limited to posttraumatic stress disorder.
            
            
              Methods
              The current protocol paper describes the {PSP} {PTSI} Study (i.e., design, measures, materials, hypotheses, planned analyses, expected implications, and limitations), which was originally designed to evaluate an evidence-informed, proactive system of mental health assessment and training among Royal Canadian Mounted Police for delivery among diverse {PSP} (i.e., firefighters, municipal police, paramedics, public safety communicators). Specifically, the {PSP} {PTSI} Study will: (1) adapt, implement, and assess the impact of a system for ongoing (i.e., annual, monthly, daily) evidence-based assessments; (2) evaluate associations between demographic variables and {PTSI}; (3) longitudinally assess individual differences associated with {PTSI}; and, (4) assess the impact of providing diverse {PSP} with a tailored version of the Emotional Resilience Skills Training originally developed for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in mitigating {PTSIs} based on the Unified Protocol for the Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders. Participants are assessed pre- and post-training, and then at a follow-up 1-year after training. The assessments include clinical interviews, self-report surveys including brief daily and monthly assessments, and daily biometric data. The current protocol paper also describes participant recruitment and developments to date.
            
            
              Discussion
              The {PSP} {PTSI} Study is an opportunity to implement, test, and improve a set of evidence-based tools and training as part of an evidence-informed solution to protect {PSP} mental health. The current protocol paper provides details to inform and support translation of the {PSP} {PTSI} Study results as well as informing and supporting replication efforts by other researchers.

	abstract = {The trade and private ownership of non-domesticated animals has detrimental effects on individual animals and their wild populations. Therefore, there is a need to understand the conditions that motivate and dissuade interest in non-domesticated pet ownership. Past research has demonstrated that the way in which non-domesticated animals are portrayed in images influences the public’s perception that they are suitable as pets. We conducted an online survey of people residing in the United States to investigate how viewing images that could be realistically captured in the zoo and broader tourism industries impact the degree to which people report interest in having that animal as a pet. We focused on two species, reticulated pythons (
              Malayopython reticulatus
              ) and two-toed sloths (
              Choloepus hoffmanni
              ), and presented each species in six different visual contexts. After viewing an image, respondents reported interest in pet ownership on a four-point Likert scale. Each species was studied separately in a between-subjects design and results were analyzed using ordinal logistic regression models. Thirty-nine percent of respondents reported interest in sloth pet ownership, and 21\% reported interest in python pet ownership. However, contrary to our hypotheses, we found that viewing these species in different visual contexts did not significantly affect survey respondents’ reported interest in having either species as a pet. Generation was a significant predictor of interest in both sloth and python pet ownership, with younger generations reporting more interest in having these species as pets. Male respondents reported more interest in python pet ownership, whereas there were no significant differences between genders regarding interest in sloth ownership. We consider how modern media exposure to animals in unnatural contexts may relate to the generational effect and discuss priorities for future research to better understand the development of individual interests in non-domesticated pet ownership.},

	title = {Perceived Femininity and Masculinity Contribute Independently to Facial Impressions},
	abstract = {In person perception research, femininity and masculinity are regularly conceived as two ends of one bipolar dimension. This unidimensional understanding permeates work on facial impressions, gender diagnosticity, and perceptions of {LGBTQ} individuals—but, it is perhaps most prominent in evolutionary work suggesting that sexually dimorphic facial features (which vary along a female–male continuum) correspond directly with subjective ratings of femininity and masculinity, which in turn predict ratings of traits such as attractiveness. In this paper, we analyze two large face databases (the Chicago and Bogazici Face Databases) to demonstrate that femininity and masculinity are distinct dimensions in person perception. We also evaluate key theoretical assumptions surrounding femininity and masculinity in evolutionary theories of face perception. We find that sexually dimorphic features weakly correlate with each other and typically explain just 10-20\% of variance in subjective ratings of femininity and masculinity. Femininity and masculinity each explain unique variance in trait ratings of attractiveness, dominance, trustworthiness, and threat. Femininity and masculinity also interact to explain unique variance in these traits, revealing facial androgyny as a novel phenomenon. We propose a new theoretical model explaining the link between biology, facial features, perceived femininity and masculinity, and trait ratings. Our findings broadly suggest that concepts that are “opposites” semantically cannot necessarily be assumed to be psychological opposites.},

	abstract = {Recent work demonstrates the methodological rigor of a type of data-driven analysis (i.e., conjoint analysis; {CA}), which accounts for the relative contribution of different facial morphological cues to interpersonal perceptions of romantic partner quality. This study extends this literature by using a conjoint face ranking task to predict the relative contribution of ﬁve sexually dimorphic facial shape features (jawbone and cheekbone prominence, eyebrow thickness, eye size, face length) to participants’ (N = 922) perceptions of facial attractiveness and sex-typicality (i.e., masculinity/femininity). For overall partner attractiveness, eyebrow thickness and jawbone prominence were relatively more salient than cheekbone prominence and eye size. Interestingly, masculinized (i.e., thicker) eyebrows were marginally more attractive for female than male faces, particularly within a long-term mating context. Masculinized jawbone prominence was more attractive for male than female faces, and feminized jawbone prominence was more attractive for female than male faces. For perceptions of masculinity, eyebrow thickness, jawbone prominence, and facial height were relatively more salient than cheekbone prominence and eye size, although facial height was more important for female than male faces, and jawbone prominence was marginally more important for male than female faces. These ﬁndings highlight the prominence of eyebrows, the jawline, and facial height during perception of facial attractiveness and masculinity – though it should be noted that many of these differences were small to moderate in effect size. Findings are interpreted in the context of prior research, and future directions for studying why these facial traits exhibit superior signaling capacity are discussed.},

In this paper, we present a language index for researchers interested in the effect of grammatical gender on the mental representations of women and men. Our index is based on ﬁve main language groups (i.e., grammatical gender languages, languages with a combination of grammatical gender and natural gender, natural gender languages, genderless languages with few traces of grammatical gender and genderless languages) and three sets of speciﬁc features (morphology, masculine-male generics and asymmetries). Our index goes beyond existing ones in that it provides speciﬁc dimensions relevant to those interested in psychological and sociological impacts of language on the way we perceive women and men.

They involve a comprehensive search to locate all relevant published and unpublished work on a subject; a systematic integration of search results; and a critique of the extent, nature, and quality of evidence in relation to a particular research question. The best reviews synthesize studies to draw broad theoretical conclusions about what a literature means, linking theory to evidence and evidence to theory. This guide describes how to plan, conduct, organize, and present a systematic review of quantitative (meta-analysis) or qualitative (narrative review, meta-synthesis) information. We outline core standards and principles and describe commonly encountered problems. Although this guide targets psychological scientists, its high level of abstraction makes it potentially relevant to any subject area or discipline. We argue that systematic reviews are a key methodology for clarifying whether and how research findings replicate and for explaining possible inconsistencies, and we call for researchers to conduct systematic reviews to help elucidate whether there is a replication crisis.},

Experiments 3 and 4 demonstrated, however, that an integrated positive imagined contact scenario does result in less intergroup anxiety and more positive attitudes, even toward this challenging group. Analyses of participants’ descriptions of the imagined interactions in and across the first three studies confirm that positive and high quality imagined contact is important for reducing prejudice, but failing to ensure that imagined contact is positive may have deleterious consequences.

The approach was developed by integrating problem-based learning and games supported by Kahoot and {PollEverWhere} (Web 2.0 applications). Two groups of first year psychology students (20 persons per group) attended practical classes based on an interactive and a traditional approach but following a different attending order (1. interactive and 2. traditional approach or vice versa) and completed two online surveys.

            We investigated whether the use of he as a generic masculine ({GM}) pronoun affects comprehension. Participants read sentences containing {GM} or sex-specific pronouns and indicated whether each sentence could refer to a female. {GM} sentences were less accurately interpreted than sex-specific sentences, indicating that the sex-specific function of masculine pronouns dominates in comprehension. We also varied sentence antecedents, and participants made fewer errors on sentences with predominantly female than predominantly male or neutral antecedents. In another experiment, we tested male and female participants under conditions of time pressure. Participants of both sexes evidenced the error pattern of Experiment 1. Findings support the hypothesis that {GM} pronouns reduce the likelihood of thoughts of females in what are intended to be non–sex-specific instances.},

Results: This review demonstrates that transgender stigma limits opportunities and access to resources in a number of critical domains (e.g., employment, healthcare), persistently affecting the physical and mental health of transgender people. The applied social ecological model employed here elucidates that transgender stigma operates at multiple levels (i.e., individual, interpersonal, structural) to impact health. Stigma prevention and coping interventions hold promise for reducing stigma and its adverse health-related effects in transgender populations.
Conclusion: Additional research is needed to document the causal relationship between stigma and adverse health as well as the mediators and moderators of stigma in {US} transgender populations. Multilevel interventions to prevent stigma towards transgender people are warranted.},

	abstract = {According to the Stereotype Content Model ({SCM}), the content of stereotypes differs on two dimensions: communion and agency. Research shows that for stereotypes about the general gender categories of “women” and “men,” there is an ambivalent pattern of communion and agency, where high levels on one dimension are associated with low levels on the other. For sexual minority stereotypes, a gender inversion has been found, whereas homosexual women are seen as more similar to men in general than to women in general, whereas homosexual men are seen as more similar to women in general than to men in general. However, there is limited research on how stereotype content for general groups relate to stereotype content for subgroups with intersecting category memberships. This research addresses this gap by investigating stereotype content at the intersection of gender and sexual orientation, including stereotype content for general gender groups, heterosexual groups, homosexual groups, and bisexual groups. In Study 1, a community sample from Sweden (N = 824) rated perceived communion and agency for women and men in general, as well as hetero-, homo-, and bisexual women and men. In Study 2, a nationally representative Swedish sample (N = 424) performed the same rating task, and in addition completed Single-Category {IATs} ({SC}-{IATs}) for warmth and competence. Results from both studies show that the stereotype content for the general categories “women” and “men” overlap with the stereotype content for heterosexual same-gender targets. Homosexual and bisexual groups were rated as more similar to their non-congruent gender category than same gender heterosexual categories were, but stereotype content for sexual minority groups did not overlap with either general gender categories, thus showing only incomplete gender inversion of stereotype content. Implicit associations between “women” and “warmth” were significantly stronger than associations between “men” and “warmth.” There were no other significant relations between implicit associations to warmth/competence and gender or sexual orientation. Theoretical and methodological implications for future research into intersectional stereotype content are presented, including how the findings inform the co-dependent relationship between a binary gender structure and a heteronormative ideology.},

Three studies tested evaluations and use of hen, and individual-level predictors. In Study 1 (N = 2145), specific hen was slightly favoured over generic hen. In Study 2 (N = 297), hen was more negatively evaluated than binary pronouns, and generic hen was more positively evaluated than specific hen. In Study 3 (N = 450), hen was less frequently used compared to binary pronouns overall but preferred in generic contexts. Traditionalism mainly predicted attitudes towards generic hen and beliefs about gender, as binary mainly predicted attitudes towards specific hen, although the pattern varied across studies. Because hen was preferred in generic contexts, but not in specific ones, this work has implications for understanding the non-acceptance of non-binary gender identities since the traditional binary notion of gender still is strong.},

We review recent methodological literature on questionable research practices, meta-analysis, and power analysis to explain the apparently high rates of failure to replicate. Psychologists can improve research practices to advance knowledge in ways that improve replicability. We recommend that researchers adopt open science conventions of preregistration and full disclosure and that replication efforts be based on multiple studies rather than on a single replication attempt. We call for more sophisticated power analyses, careful consideration of the various inﬂuences on effect sizes, and more complete disclosure of nonsigniﬁcant as well as statistically signiﬁcant ﬁndings.},

Interviews explored the participants’ experiences in arriving at their gender identity. This article presents three clusters of ﬁndings related to the common processes of transgender identity development. This process was made possible by accessibility of transgender narratives that injected hope into what was a childhood replete with criticism and scrutiny. Ultimately, participants came to their identities through balancing a desire for authenticity with demands of necessity—meaning that they weighed their internal gender experience with considerations about their available resources, coping skills, and the consequences of gender transitions. The implications of these ﬁndings are considered in terms of their contribution to gender theory, research, and clinical support for transgender clients.},

The application of traditional analytic methods to the data from such studies can result in serious bias in testing experimental effects. In this review, we develop a comprehensive typology of designs involving two random factors, which may be either crossed or nested, and one ﬁxed factor, condition. We present appropriate linear mixed models for all designs and develop effect size measures. We provide the tools for power estimation for all designs. We then discuss issues of design choice, highlighting power and feasibility considerations.

However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using {LMEMs} for conﬁrmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that {LMEMs} generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justiﬁed by the design. The generalization performance of {LMEMs} including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only {LMEMs} used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal {LMEMs} should be the ‘gold standard’ for conﬁrmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

	abstract = {Mediation analysis requires a number of strong assumptions be met in order to make valid causal inferences. Failing to account for violations of these assumptions, such as not modeling measurement error or omitting a common cause of the effects in the model, can bias the parameter estimates of the mediated effect. When the independent variable is perfectly reliable, for example when participants are randomly assigned to levels of treatment, measurement error in the mediator tends to underestimate the mediated effect, while the omission of a confounding variable of the mediator-to-outcome relation tends to overestimate the mediated effect. Violations of these two assumptions often co-occur, however, in which case the mediated effect could be overestimated, underestimated, or even, in very rare circumstances, unbiased. To explore the combined effect of measurement error and omitted confounders in the same model, the effect of each violation on the single-mediator model is first examined individually. Then the combined effect of having measurement error and omitted confounders in the same model is discussed. Throughout, an empirical example is provided to illustrate the effect of violating these assumptions on the mediated effect.},

The degree programme was written collaboratively by teacher educators in two Institutes of Teacher Education in Malaysia and in the University of Hertfordshire, {UK}, to meet the requirements for training Malaysian school teachers to teach in Malaysian schools. A cohort of 120 students studied the programme full-time over four years, graduating in 2010. The three principles of the {ARM} approach were chosen to underpin the learning and teaching for the programme. These principles highlight the role of active participation and active learning on the part of the learner; the value of reflective learning and reflection for both student teachers and pupils; and modelling by staff to student teachers and by student teachers to pupils in school. The approach was aligned with the curriculum specifications for mathematics in primary schools in Malaysia, which emphasised components of active learning. This article explains how the {ARM} approach was developed, shared and used during the {BEd} degree programme; provides the rationale for selecting the three principles; and describes the research methods used to explore the views and experiences of programme participants. Some findings from the research are presented, drawn from a dataset that comprises survey responses from more than 180 participants: Malaysian senior managers, teacher educators, student teachers and school mentors. The findings are discussed in the context of using {ARM} in teacher education and in primary schools in Malaysia, and of implementing change in learning and teaching. Throughout this project the teacher educators from Malaysia and the {UK} engaged in dialogue about their professional practice and learnt about the personal, professional and cultural values and beliefs that shaped the pedagogies of both parties and of the individual practitioners. The value of articulating pedagogy as a means of developing practice endorses the views of others with expertise in this area who stress the importance of making pedagogies explicit in teacher education and has implications for the practice of student teachers and teacher educators.},

	abstract = {Starting in 2019, the ongoing {COVID}-19 pandemic has lasted 3 years and will likely continue to affect the lives of people all over the world. According to a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ({UNESCO}) survey, more than 91\% of students from all over the world have been affected by the spread of {COVID}-19. The application of technological networks can help solve problems related to being unable to attend school in person, as online teaching can effectively help reduce learning loss in the short term. In Taiwan, the higher education system has been using online learning, but now faces a new and huge crisis, as some courses do not readily translate to this setting. In professional courses run by hospitality departments, it is essentially impossible to accurately convey the practical skills required, for example, aspects of color, aroma, and taste through online teaching. Moreover, the learning level of each student varies greatly. During the online teaching process, instructors teach professional skills and movements through a single teaching video, which may not meet the needs of all students. In response, this study explores using the flipped teaching method, to not only enable students to master and control their learning and effectively adjust their self- adaptive learning progress but also to help teachers solve problems and impart professional skills using a two-way, interactive, online teaching method. This approach, flipping a class in an online learning environment, could effectively make up for the one-way teaching sometimes created by video content, and address the problem of gaps in learning professional practical skills. It can also induce students with poor learning attitudes to actively participate in learning. This study involved 55 bachelor students from a university of science and technology in Taiwan. The research results are as follows: (1) Students who participated in the flipped teaching mode, which involved two-way interaction showed better professional understanding of the course and improved willingness to learn, thereby improving the learning effect. (2) Awareness of these poor practical catering professional skills in students, assisted in laying the professional foundation for students to gradually improve their learning attitude and their advanced skills. This indicates that students with poor academic performance in an online environment might benefit from two-way interactive teaching. Teachers should clarify detailed descriptions of professional practical actions that confuse students. (3) In flipped learning, the grouping of “game/toy-based e-learning” can not only improve the performance of students who actively study to achieve good grades but also help and motivate other students to learn together. These results indicate that in flipped classrooms that use an online learning environment, the active learning and learning attitudes of students were positive and that their interest in learning and learning efficiency was also significantly improved. At the same time, this approach stimulated the innovation, creativity, and creative development of students in using professional technology in the hospitality industry. It transformed the passive learning situation of online one-way teaching into an active two-way teaching environment.},

In learning courses, both live animals and virtual training laboratories have been found to enhance learning, but less research has examined student preferences. Generally, live rats are preferred, but students may resist these experiences. Additionally, both laboratory types have drawbacks. Objective: This study examined student preferences for learning laboratory experiences. Method: The current study surveyed students to understand preferences between laboratory experiences and within a virtual program. Speciﬁcally, students were asked preference for species and between realistic and cartoon versions. Results: Participants preferred live animals, but the difﬁculties of working with live animals may require the use of virtual laboratory programs. For those programs, students preferred realistic dogs. Additionally, based on these preferences a pilot program was designed and tested in a class. The students supported the inclusion of the program for similar classes and provided feedback for improvement. Conclusions: Live animal laboratories are worthwhile when feasible, but well-designed virtual programs can be beneﬁcial for engaging and impactful learning experiences. Teaching Implications: Instructors should consider using live or virtual animal laboratories for psychology of learning courses.},

This study collected repeat-measure data from undergraduate students enrolled in a two-semester course sequence to evaluate factors affecting student enrollment decisions and student attitudes toward learning. We integrated this combination of research tools using a {QuantCrit} analytic framework, which revealed student attitudes and decision-making processes that were generally stable over the study period for individuals, but very different when examining student enrollment groups over time. Limited access to active learning classrooms forced students to self-sort based on either their social networks or their attitudes toward learning. That, in turn, may create a marginalizing force that pushes out some students—most often women—from undergraduate programs.},

Objective: This study explores motivational and contextual factors that underlie individual differences in students’ willingness to attend {UTA} facilitated supplemental workshops and the impact of such engagement on their achievement.
Method: Undergraduates (N = 112) in research and statistics courses completed measures of help-seeking, social ﬁt, and expectancy value three times across the semester. Responses were compared to students’ attendance records, exam scores, and open-ended responses evaluating beneﬁts and challenges of working with {UTAs}.
Results: Given the choice, a majority of students chose to attend workshops and consistent participation was positively correlated with exam performance. Yet help-seeking intentions, social ﬁt, value beliefs, and perceived obstacles rather than incentives or perceived costs explained individual differences in workshop participation itself.
Conclusion: {UTAs} can improve peer’s achievement but simply providing students with opportunities to interact with {UTAs} is inadequate. Scaffolding active participation in {UTA}-led workshops requires addressing students’ motivational orientations.},

Combined with learning satisfaction and Technology Acceptance Model ({TAM}), this paper proposes an Online Active Learning ({OAL}) Model to predict the influencing factors of college students’ active learning behavior and then analyzes the differences between {OMO} model and pure online model by multi-group analysis ({MGA}) based on the model. The designed questionnaire was distributed, and a total of 498 valid questionnaires were collected. Using {SmartPLS} to analyze partial least squares structural equation modeling ({PLS}-{SEM}) and {MGA}, it is found that: (1) there are differences in the influencing factors of active learning between {OMO} and pure online model; the moderating effect of learning complaint in {OMO} mode is not established, and social isolation and age does not affect active learning in {OMO} mode; (2) learning quality, perceived ease of use, expectation, perceived usefulness, and social isolation indirectly affect active learning through learning satisfaction in both {OMO} model and pure online model; (3) learning satisfaction is an important mediating variable affecting active learning; and (4) learning complaints will negatively regulate the relationship between learning satisfaction and active learning only in pure online model. According to these findings, the paper provides theoretical and practical implementation suggestions implications for {OMO} teaching and {OAL} to ensure the expected learning outcome.},

Research has demonstrated that this can improve student performance versus traditional lecturer-led teaching methods.
Objective: During the {COVID}-19 pandemic, the vast majority of teaching has been entirely online such that even ‘in-class’ time has been virtual. The current article examined whether online-only delivery affects the efﬁcacy of the ﬂipped classroom approach.
Method: Grades for a research methods and statistics module and a statistics portfolio assignment were compared across consecutive cohorts of undergraduate psychology students taught by different methods.
Results: Overall grades on the module did not differ signiﬁcantly across teaching methods but student performance on statistics tests did. Flipped classrooms, whether accompanied by on-campus or synchronous online classes, led to signiﬁcantly better performance than traditional methods. No detriment was observed by teaching entirely online.
Conclusion: The key advantages of the ﬂipped classroom method appear driven by active learning which can occur irrespective of classroom context. Teaching Implications: Using ﬂipped classrooms can be a useful tool, particularly in subjects where students may otherwise be less engaged with the content.},

            If K‐12 students are to be fully integrated as active participants in their own learning, understanding how they interpret formative assessment feedback is needed. The objective of this article is to advance three claims about why teachers and assessment scholars/specialists may have little understanding of students’ interpretation of formative assessment feedback. The three claims are as follows. First, there is little systematic research of K‐12 students’ interpretations of feedback. Systematic research requires gathering substantive evidence of students’ cognitive and emotional processes using psychological methods and tools. Second, there is an overemphasis on the external assessment process at the expense of uncovering learners’ internal reasoning and emotional processes. This overemphasis may be due to vestiges of behavioral approaches and lack of training in social cognitive methods. Third, there are psychological tools such as the clinical interview, pioneered by Piaget and used by psychologists to “enter the child's mind,” which may be helpful in uncovering students’ interpretation of feedback and associated behavioral responses. If the purpose of formative assessment is to change student learning, and feedback is delivered as a conduit to help with this long‐term change, understanding students’ interpretation of feedback plays a central role in the validity of the process.},

The embodied cognition literature suggests the physical actions we perform and the actions being performed around us shape our mental experience. We argue that students mentally imitate the gestures of their professor, this activity contributes to the embodied experience one has in a classroom, and that this increased activity leads to increased recall. One possible reason for increased student learning in human-centered environments is the activation of mirror neurons. Implications for teaching topics in a psychology classroom are discussed.},

Condition “hilarity” ratings are compared, and the class as a whole discusses issues relating to experimental design including internal validity, random assignment, and independent and dependent variables.

The approach was developed by integrating problem-based learning and games supported by Kahoot and {PollEverWhere} (Web 2.0 applications). Two groups of first year psychology students (20 persons per group) attended practical classes based on an interactive and a traditional approach but following a different attending order (1. interactive and 2. traditional approach or vice versa) and completed two online surveys.

In the higher university context, serious games, gamification and game-based learning, are designed to make educational processes more efficient. A growing body of research has shown that the incorporation of games in the classroom is often more effective than traditional teaching methods in terms of active participation, concentration, development of social and solving problems skills, academic achievements and performance among university students. Furthermore, games can enhance intrinsic motivation, flow experiences, and engagement, as well as some relevant key groups’ skills as teamworking. In order words, learning would be interesting, motivating, engaging, funny and effective through games.},

Over the course of the semester, students completed seven assignments, each representing a stage of the research process. Students formed hypotheses, tested their hypotheses using data from the class, interpreted their results, generated future directions, created {PowerPoint} slides summarizing their projects, and presented their results in a poster session. We found support for the hypothesis that the research methods intervention would lead to better performance on a research methods quiz compared to students in a nonintervention section taught by the same instructor. This intervention demonstrated that it is feasible to use project-oriented active-learning techniques to foster understanding of research methods in large classes.},

The purpose of the article is to describe the content of the educational technology of problem interpretations by the example of the formation of the ethical competencies of students. The article describes the educational technology, which is based on the idea of knowledge constructing by students independently during learning processes. Theoretical base of technology consists of three main approaches: about the zones of nearest development, about the student as an initiator of development and self-development during educational activities, about constructivism in education. Also it combines the key ideas about constructing and self-constructing, problem-based learning and creativity. The leading method of research was forming experiment, which allowed to explore and to test all the main aspects of the proposed technology. The article presents the results of the approbation of technology which ensured the growth of ethical development among students. The algorithm of technology can be used by teachers and graduate students of higher educational institutions for various disciplines with an ethical focus and ethical content.},

Using a counterbalanced alternating treatment design, a direct comparison of three {ASR} methods (clickers, response cards, and hand-raising) and a control condition was conducted across four sections of a general psychology course. Students scored almost 5\% higher on exams after utilizing an {ASR} approach than during control conditions. However, no statistically significant differences were found between experimental conditions.

	abstract = {Game‐based learning is often described as a balancing act between the serious subject matter of learning and using immersive problem solving applications to retain and apply the said subject matter in real world. Games in general, can be summed as leisure construct with an intrinsic problem solving mechanism. The juxtaposition of psychology and sociology as a medium to pragmatically construct a methodology towards the classification of subject and applied methods within game‐based learning would assist in finding the right tools for the right individual. One of the biggest drawbacks to the experiential pedagogical process of game‐based learning is that it often places the tools entirely on the facilitator. Moreover the assignment of the types of game without clear learning objectives or the assignment of the inappropriate game itself would reduce the entire experience to just mere game playing. Thus, the role of practitioners or facilitators is not about the teaching of specific knowledge or choosing the right tools for the learners, but they are one of helping the learner to discover the right tools that work for them. According to constructive and experiential learning methods, the learner is not a passive recipient of learning in any particular knowledge but is active in its gathering, analysing and manipulation. What this research intends to do is to find a method of classification of the recipients and type of game that would correlate to the students for the most immersive and constructive ways of information retention.},

Its use, however, was resisted by advocates of social Darwinism (who believed that students must be taught to survive in a “dog-eat-dog” world) and individualism (who believed in the myth of the “rugged individualist”). Despite the resistance, cooperative learning is now an accepted, and often the preferred, instructional procedures at all levels of education. Cooperative learning is being used in postsecondary education in every part of the world. It is difficult to find a text on instructional methods, a journal on teaching, or instructional guidelines that do not discuss cooperative learning. Materials on cooperative learning have been translated into dozens of languages. Cooperative learning is one of the success stories of both psychology and education. One of the most distinctive characteristics of cooperative learning, and perhaps the reason for its success, is the close relationship between theory, research, and practice. In this article, social interdependence theory will be reviewed, the research validating the theory will be summarized, and the five basic elements needed to understand the dynamics of cooperation and operationalize the validated theory will be discussed. Finally the controversies in the research and the remaining questions that need to be answered by future research will be noted.},

	abstract = {Teaching of psychology as a science in Italy has developed steadily over the last few decades. University programs have experienced growth and psychology programs in some secondary schools and in teacher training programs may be better developed than those in other countries. Italian secondary school programs last for 5 years, and psychology is taught every year for both semesters. A postgraduate course, which includes training in psychology, is now mandatory for all public school teachers in Italy, as well. The first level of university education in psychology now corresponds to “Class 34”, Psychological Sciences and Techniques, and includes courses such as: Behaviour and Social Relation Sciences; Clinical and Community Sciences; and Techniques and Psychology of Educational Relations. Each course contains different aspects of a fixed national curriculum. All share a general scientific focus and teach practical abilities in specific areas of psychology. Two types of degrees are possible for undergraduates. A 3-year degree qualifies students to practice as a “psychological assistant” in a restricted range of areas. A 3-year degree followed by an additional 2 years of study allows the graduate to practise as a psychologist. Graduate programs then provide specific specialization focus. At present there are over 500 psychology faculty members in Italian universities. Goals of university psychology programs are to facilitate student mastery of the wealth of information in the discipline and to prepare competent psychologists. The lecture is a common teaching method. In the last decade, many teachers have also adopted more active learning methods. Discussions of assigned readings are used. In addition, students engage in guided practice activities, conduct library research, participate in empirical studies, and write in-depth papers on various aspects of psychology. Course grades are generally determined by written tests that include both multiple-choice and free-response items. Field placement is typically evaluated through written reports and practical exercises.},

The biggest challenge with incorporating active-learning strategies in the classroom is the time constraint of the traditional class period. One of the approaches that is finding increasing acceptance among educators is the use of the flipped classroom. This paper shares details of the impact of active-learning on academic achievement of students from groups underrepresented in {STEM} in introductory mathematics and aerospace engineering courses.

In sharp contrast, 48 courses (N=4458) which made substantial use of {IE} methods achieved an average gain 〈g〉{IE}-ave=0.48±0.14 (std dev), almost two standard deviations of 〈g〉{IE}-ave above that of the traditional courses. Results for 30 (N=3259) of the above 62 courses on the problem-solving Mechanics Baseline test of Hestenes–Wells imply that {IE} strategies enhance problem-solving ability.

To better understand active learning, we constructed this review through an innovative interdisciplinary collaboration involving research teams from psychology and discipline-based education research ({DBER}). Our collaboration examined active learning from two different perspectives (i.e., psychology and {DBER}) and surveyed the current landscape of undergraduate {STEM} instructional practices related to the modes of active learning and traditional lecture. On that basis, we concluded that active learning—which is commonly used to communicate an alternative to lecture and does serve a purpose in higher education classroom practice—is an umbrella term that is not particularly useful in advancing research on learning. To clarify, we synthesized a working definition of active learning that operates within an elaborative framework, which we call the construction-of-understanding ecosystem. A cornerstone of this framework is that undergraduate learners should be active agents during instruction and that the social construction of meaning plays an important role for many learners, above and beyond their individual cognitive construction of knowledge. Our proposed framework offers a coherent and actionable concept of active learning with the aim of advancing future research and practice in undergraduate {STEM} education.},

	abstract = {Significance
            The President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology has called for a 33\% increase in the number of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ({STEM}) bachelor’s degrees completed per year and recommended adoption of empirically validated teaching practices as critical to achieving that goal. The studies analyzed here document that active learning leads to increases in examination performance that would raise average grades by a half a letter, and that failure rates under traditional lecturing increase by 55\% over the rates observed under active learning. The analysis supports theory claiming that calls to increase the number of students receiving {STEM} degrees could be answered, at least in part, by abandoning traditional lecturing in favor of active learning.
          , 
            
              To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ({STEM}) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 {SDs} under active learning (
              n
              = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (
              n
              = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6\% in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the {STEM} disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes—although the greatest effects are in small (
              n
              ≤ 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe
              n
              calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate {STEM} education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms.},

Improving educationa outcomes will require efforts on many fronts, but a central premise of this monograph is that one part of a solution invol helping students to better regulate their learning through the use of effective learning techniques. Fortunately, cognitive educational psychologists have been developing and evaluating easy-to-use learning techniques that could help students achie their learning goals. In this monograph, we discuss 10 learning techniques in detail and offer recommendations about th relative utility.We selected techniques that were expected to be relatively easy to use and hence could be adopted by man students. Also, some techniques (e.g., highlighting and rereading) were selected because students report relying heavily o them, which makes it especially important to examine how well they work.The techniques include elaborative interrogat self-explanation, summarization, highlighting (or underlining), the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, reread practice testing, distributed practice, and interleaved practice. To offer recommendations about the relative utility of these techniques, we evaluated whether their benefits generaliz across four categories of variables: learning conditions, student characteristics, materials, and criterion tasks. Learning condi include aspects of the learning environment in which the technique is implemented, such as whether a student studies a or with a group. Student characteristics include variables such as age, ability, and level of prior knowledge. Materials vary f simple concepts to mathematical problems to complicated science texts. Criterion tasks include different outcome measur that are relevant to student achievement, such as those tapping memory, problem solving, and comprehension.},

We argue that inconsistency and fragmentation in perceptions of inclusive pedagogies is the result of inclusion itself being a philosophically contested matter; and that this needs to be reﬂected in the way that inclusive pedagogies are discussed in {HE} – even if this goes against current performative and market-driven trends that emphasise quick ﬁxes over acknowledging the complexity of pedagogic issues.},

Gender scores have long been used in psychological studies to understand the complex psychosocial relationships between people. Perceptual scores for gender and attractiveness have been employed for quality assessment and planning of cosmetic facial surgery. Various neurological disorders have been linked to the facial structure in general and the facial gender perception in particular. While, subjective gender scoring by human raters has been a tool of choice for psychological studies for many years, the process is both time and resource consuming. In this study, we investigate the geometric features used by the human cognitive system in perceiving the degree of masculinity/femininity of a 3D face. We then propose a mathematical model that can mimic the human gender perception. For our experiments, we obtained 3D face scans of 64 subjects using the 3dMDface scanner. The textureless 3D face scans of the subjects were then observed in different poses and assigned a gender score by 75 raters of a similar background. Our results suggest that the human cognitive system employs a combination of Euclidean and geodesic distances between biologically significant landmarks of the face for gender scoring. We propose a mathematical model that is able to automatically assign an objective gender score to a 3D face with a correlation of up to 0.895 with the human subjective scores.},

The relationship between masculinity and distinctiveness, however, has received little attention. In Expt 1, we examine how current averaging techniques and manipulated sexual dimorphism influence ratings of attractiveness, masculinity, and distinctiveness. In agreement with previous studies, composite faces were found to be more attractive than individual faces. Averaging resulted in increased ratings of attractiveness but decreased ratings of masculinity and distinctiveness. This supports both that attractiveness is related to averageness and findings showing a preference for feminine traits in male faces. When controlling for attractiveness, no significant relationship was found between masculinity and distinctiveness. Manipulating sexual dimorphism did not alter distinctiveness ratings, indicating that feminized and masculinized faces are equally distinctive. These results are suggestive that masculinity and distinctiveness are separable components in face perception. In Expt 2, we look to improve on previous studies utilizing composite faces by examining how averaging in texture‐only or shape‐only changes perceptions of attractiveness, masculinity, and distinctiveness. Averaging in both shape and texture were found to increase attractiveness independently, showing that the increased attractiveness of composites is due to the combined action of these two manipulations.},

We investigated this claim by using a word-picture matching task directly assessing mental representations activated by the asterisk. Students evaluated whether pictures of persons read as male, female, or nonbinary were suitable illustrations of immediately preceding role nouns in masculine, feminine, or star form. Processing difficulties for female pictures following masculine nouns confirmed that the latter was not automatically read as generic. High acceptance rates and low reaction times for all pictures following the asterisk suggest it leads to inclusive mental representations including men, women, and persons beyond the gender binary.

              Research on gender‐fair language aims to identify language inclusive to a multitude of individuals, for example, increasing the visibility of women by using paired pronouns (he/she) instead of generic masculine forms (he). However, binary presentations like he/she might come with unwanted side effects and evoke what we label as normative gender bias. A normative gender bias is defined as when words lead to stronger associations with individuals with normative gender expressions than with individuals with non‐normative gender expressions, thus contributing to making non‐normative individuals invisible. In three experiments, we compared the extent to which the paired pronoun he/she (Swedish and English), the neo‐pronouns
              hen
              (Swedish),
              ze
              (English), and the generic pronoun singular they (English) evoked a normative gender bias. Swedish‐ (
              N
               = 219 and 268) and English‐ (
              N
               = 837, from the {UK}) speaking participants read about individuals referred to with the paired pronoun he/she or with hen, ze, or they. In Experiment 1 (Swedish), there was no main effect of condition on a normative bias, but in Experiment 2 (Swedish), the paired pronouns he/she evoked normative gender bias while hen did not. In Experiment 3 (English), both ze and singular they evoked normative gender bias, although normative associations were lower in these conditions compared to he/she. Furthermore, the normative bias was lower among participants who had knowledge about the use of ze as a nonbinary pronoun. Finally, neither ze nor they evoked a normative gender bias when their use was explicitly stated to be nonbinary. A potential explanation for why singular they did not generally result in less normative associations, despite almost all participants knowing about it, may include its more common use as a generic pronoun. Taken together, our results suggest that neo‐pronouns, but not paired pronouns, have the potential to evoke less normative associations, but that they must be both (1) actively created new words and (2) well‐known to language users as nonbinary pronouns.},

	abstract = {Introduction:
              Virtual human work regarding gender is widely based on binary gender despite recent understandings of gender extending beyond female and male. Additionally, gender stereotypes and biases may be present in virtual human design.
            
            
              Methods:
              This study evaluates how face gender cues are implemented in virtual humans by conducting an exploratory study where an undergraduate computing population (
              n
              = 67) designed three virtual human faces—female, male, and nonbinary.
            
            
              Results:
              Results showed that face gender cues were implemented in stereotypical ways to represent binary genders (female and male virtual humans). For nonbinary gender virtual humans, stereotypical face gender cues were expressed inconsistently (sometimes feminine, sometimes masculine), and conflicting gender cues (pairs of cues that signal opposing binary gender) occurred frequently. Finally, results revealed that not all face gender cues are leveraged equally to express gender.
            
            
              Discussion:
              Implications of these findings and future directions for inclusive and representative gender expression in virtual humans are discussed.},

In two factorial survey experiments, we investigated gender categorization and stereotyping of gender-ambiguous targets based on facial features and behavioral information. We manipulated femininity/masculinity/ambiguity of face, expression, and occupation. Participants completed a gender categorization task, and stereotype and attitude measures. The findings indicated that face was most influential for categorization: When face was unambiguously masculine or feminine, participants mostly categorized targets as male or female, respectively. In these cases, expression and occupation had little influence on categorization. When face was ambiguous, this additional information significantly influenced categorization. Nonbinary categorization was more likely for ambiguous faces, and most likely for ambiguous faces combined with ambiguous expression and ambiguous or feminine occupation. Our findings suggest that categorizing gender-ambiguous targets is more complex compared to clearly gendered targets. Primarily relying on face when it appears clearly gendered likely causes categorization errors when encountering {TGNC} individuals.},

            Color carries gender information (e.g., red-female). This study explored whether background color could influence the gender categorization of human faces. Visual stimuli were generated from faces whose sexually dimorphic content was morphed monotonically from female to male perception. The face stimulus was presented upright (Experiment 1) and inverted (Experiment 2) with three background colors (i.e., red, green, and gray). Participants were instructed to categorize the gender of the face stimulus as male or female by pressing one of two labelled keys. Results showed that a red background could bias the gender of an ambiguous upright face toward a female compared with green and gray background colors (Experiment 1). However, this red effect was diminished when the face stimulus was inverted (Experiment 2). These results suggest that red background color interacting with facial configuration features biases gender perception toward a female face, possibly through top-down processing of learned associations between the color red and femininity.},

	abstract = {Background: Individuals make first impressions of others based on how they look. Facial cues trigger gender social categorisation and elicit gender stereotyping. However, it remains unclear to what extent such impressions are influenced by the perceivers’ gender identity and gender beliefs.
Methods: We recruited cisgender and transgender and nonbinary ({TGNB}) participants (N = 195). Participants were shown three morphed faces (prototypical male versus. prototypical female versus. androgynous) and, for each target, were asked to create a sentence describing their first impression. (within-participants design). To do so, they had to choose from a list of pronouns, professions, and personality traits. Participants also reported how confident they were in their first impression and rated the gender of the targets.
Results: Results showed that overall participants perceived the prototypical male target as masculine while both the prototypical female and androgynous targets were seen as feminine. Participants also felt more confident when forming an impression about the prototypical male target. Further, impressions were influenced by perceivers’ gender identity. Cisgender participants formed stronger stereotypical impressions of the prototypical male and female target than {TGNB} participants. In particular, cisgender participants were more likely to use masculine pronouns for the prototypical male target and more feminine pronouns for the prototypical female target, but less neutral pronouns for the androgynous target, than {TGNB} participants. The difference is pronoun use was mediated by cisgender participants stronger endorsement of gender binary beliefs.
Conclusions: These findings provide new insights into face-based stereotyping and show the importance of considering different stereotype components and individual differences such as gender},

Cisgender, heterosexual men and women (N ¼ 319) received randomly assigned labels (cisgender cross-gender, transgender man, transgender woman, or nonbinary) paired with 48 cross-sex targets represented by photos and rated the attractiveness and related characteristics of those targets. The gender identity labels had a strong, pervasive effect on ratings of attraction. Nonbinary and especially transgender targets were perceived as less attractive than cisgender targets. The effect was particularly strong for male perceivers, and for women with traditional gender attitudes. Sexual and romantic attraction are not driven solely by sexed appearance; information about gender identity and transgender status also influences these assessments. These results have important implications for theoretical models of sexual orientation and for the dating lives of transgender people.},

It also seeks to examine their motivations, expectations and attitudes towards the subject. By means of an anonymous questionnaire filled in during the first session of the course, Spanish students from Pharmacy, Biology and Environmental Sciences degrees reflected on the {ESP} teaching-learning process. The results obtained have revealed the (too) many aspects of specialised languages that students are not familiar with and the preliminary lack, in general, of basic English language knowledge from their disciplines. Presumably, as this and further studies on the topic will try to corroborate, this may be due to a nearly total lack of exposure to English language both in their everyday life and in their degrees, something illogical given the lingua franca status of this language nowadays and thus its importance in the transmission and spreading of scientific knowledge and results. On the basis of students’ answers and views on the different aspects posed, a series of conclusions have been drawn and a broad course of action grounded on awareness-raising practices and students’ attitudes and expectations has been suggested with the aim of overcoming the problems and inconsistencies brought to light by the questionnaires. Hence, this study is intended to be the first in a series analysing final performance and thus the evolution experienced.},

In the transgender context, it usually refers to cases where a transgender person is referred to using the gender assigned at birth, rather than according to gender presentation. Misgendering is sometimes a form of anti-trans aggression, but can also be accidental or otherwise unintended. “Self-misgendering”, where transgender speakers unintentionally misgender themselves, is apparently previously unstudied, seems mainly to occur in a foreign-language context, and may bear some similarity to language-interference effects observed in the study of multilinguals, a “first-gender effect” analogous to first-language effects. One may also hypothesise social gender bias, variable gender-identity, or similar factors. This article quantitatively surveys self-reported self-misgendering among multilingual transgender speakers to identify factors of correlation or causation. Using data and respondents’ comments from an online survey, it shows strong correlation between self-misgendering by full-time transgender speakers and (lack of) fluency in the language spoken, with no significant correlation to other linguistic or social gender-related factors. This suggests the self-misgendering phenomenon is primarily a fluency effect, independent of social or identity factors such as attitude to gender in language, attitude to being misgendered, or “default” masculine gender.},

Such deployments are morally contestable, that is, they can be challenged on ethical or political grounds. Two characterizations of “woman” proposed in the feminist literature are critiqued from this perspective. When we consider what would happen to transgender women upon the broad implementation of these characterizations within transgender women's social context, we discover that they suffer from two defects: they either exclude at least some transgender women, or else they implicitly foster hierarchies among women, marginalizing transgender women in particular. In conclusion, I claim that the moral contestability of gender‐term deployments acts as a stimulus to regularly consider the provisionality and revisability of our deployments of the term “woman.”},

Forms of cisgenderism that have been explored in empirical research include pathologizing, which refers to constructing or treating people's genders, bodies, and experiences associated with their genders and bodies as disordered (e.g., “gender identity disorder,” “gender dysphoria,” and “disorders of sex development”), and misgendering, which misclassifies people's genders and bodies (e.g., describing a woman who was assigned as male as “a man”). In contrast to approaches that treat “cisgender” and “transgender” people as essentially distinct types of people, the assumption that all people fit into a “transgender/cisgender” binary is understood in the cisgenderism framework as an essentializing form of cisgenderism that excludes a variety of people from consideration, including, but not limited to, intersex people and women with polycystic ovary syndrome.},

	abstract = {This paper analyses responses to the 2018 Gender Recognition Act reform consultation in the {UK}, exploring reasons behind the widespread anti-trans sentiment in this context. It compares the conservative Christian roots of traditional opposition to {LGBT}+ rights, which is still the major source of anti-trans politics in the {US}, with the rise in prominence of a specific feminist opposition to trans rights in the last few years in the {UK}. It then explores why the beliefs of relatively small groups have had such a compelling influence on a wider audience in the general population. It argues that the gendered socialisation we all experience through education, media, and political institutions creates a baseline belief in gender determinism and oppositional sexism, and as many people’s main source of information about trans people is the recent surge in related media, a trans moral panic propagated through mainstream and social media easily creates misinformed beliefs about trans issues. A major conclusion of this paper is that trans people have been constructed in the public imagination predominantly in terms of threat- threat to investment in gendered norms, threat to one’s own gender identity, and for marginalised groups including women and also other {LGBT}+ people, threat to their own in-group resources and desires for assimilation into mainstream culture. Anti-trans sentiment is therefore not only about ideology, but also has important emotional components that should not be overlooked when considering ways to tackle transphobia.},

Study 1 (N ¼ 489, {UK}) explored the role of individual gender identification in defense of, and attempts to reinforce, the gender/sex binary. Study 2 (N ¼ 415, Sweden) further considered the role of individual differences in need for closure. Both gender identification and need for closure were associated with binary views of gender/sex, prejudice against nonbinary people, and opposition to the use of gender-neutral pronouns. Policies that aim to abolish gender/sex categories, but not policies that advocate for a third gender/sex category, were seen as particularly unfair among people high in gender identification. These findings are an important step in understanding the psychology of resistance to change around binary systems of gender/sex.},

Although others have theorized about the connection between grammatical gender in language and societal gender equality (Stahlberg et al. 2007), the current work tests this link empirically by examining differences in gender equality between countries with gendered, natural gender, and genderless language systems. Of the 111 countries investigated, our findings suggest that countries where gendered languages are spoken evidence less gender equality compared to countries with other grammatical gender systems. Furthermore, countries where natural gender languages are spoken demonstrate greater gender equality, which may be due to the ease of creating gender symmetric revisions to instances of sexist language.},

Masculine job titles were more strongly associated with men relative to women. In contrast, job titles using the slash form and gender-neutral form eliminated this male bias in implicit associations. The masculine form with brackets (m/f/d) produced similar effects to the conventional masculine form, and as such, was also ineffective in reducing a male bias.

	abstract = {People think of certain social roles (e.g., scientists) as being men, but perhaps even more fundamentally, people also tend to think of a person as a man. People list men more often than women as examples of humanity and describe men with generic labels (e.g., the person) but use gender-specific labels (e.g., the woman) for women. This is especially true of male respondents. Much of the research on this androcentric tendency to conflate men with people has measured more controllable behaviors. The present studies instead investigated androcentrism using adaptations of the implicit association test ({IAT}). The {IAT} more closely captures theoretically relevant categorization cognitive processes; responses on the {IAT} are more difficult to control and thus suitable for socially-sensitive topics like gender bias; and the {IAT} can help to explain gender differences in androcentrism. Results from three studies showed that participants associated broad human concepts (e.g., person) with men more than women (Studies 1–3), and gender-specific concepts (e.g., woman) with women more than men (Studies 2–3). These {IAT} associations were larger for male (vs. female) participants (Studies 1–3) and for participants exposed to a male-emphasizing (vs. gender-inclusive) term for humanity (i.e., mankind; Study 3). Participants were also more likely to notice a semantic redundancy between being male and being human compared to the same redundancy concerning women (Studies 2–3). Together, these findings support a categorization-based theoretical account of androcentrism, advancing understanding of the nature of androcentrism and gender differences therein.},

In turn, this measure of similarity in linguistic context also captures the extent to which the concepts being denoted are similar. When extracted from massive corpora of text written by millions of individuals, this measure of linguistic similarity can provide insight into the collective concepts of a linguistic community, concepts that both reflect and reinforce widespread ways of thinking. Using this approach, we investigated the collective concept

              people
              , which forms the basis for nearly all societal decision- and policy-making. In three studies and three preregistered replications with similarity metrics extracted from a corpus of over 630 billion English words, we found that the collective concept

	abstract = {As society becomes more open and welcoming to those of gender identities beyond the binary, it becomes increasingly important to understand their gender identity and presentation. Part of understanding these concepts means understanding how gender identities can exist relationally. Using in-depth interviews, this study explores how nonbinary college students respond to misgendering or deadnaming. These responses involve reflected appraisals, which social psychologists find can impact one’s sense of self and cause alterations in their self-presentation. These data show that nonbinary college students navigate being deadnamed or misgendered through their gender presentation in two primary manners: one, by adjusting presentation to be more affirming to their gender identity; and two, by maintaining their current presentation with the goal of preserving their physical comfort. These data support the notion that gender presentation is a performance, showing that nonbinary young adults consciously adjust their gender presentation to bring about social and physical comfort with their gender identity and, to some extent, to limit conflict in social interactions.},

In this article, we analyze current controversies in this area, including choosing effect sizes, why and whether power analyses should be conducted on already-collected data, how to mitigate the negative effects of sample size criteria on specific kinds of research, and which power criterion to use. For novel research questions, we advocate that researchers base sample sizes on effects that are likely to be cost-effective for other people to implement (in applied settings) or to study (in basic research settings), given the limitations of interest-based minimums or field-wide effect sizes. We discuss two alternatives to power analysis, precision analysis and sequential analysis, and end with recommendations for improving the practices of researchers, reviewers, and journal editors in social-personality psychology.},

While the arguments of new materialism are in accordance with the analysis of the act of observation performed by an external observer, some problems arise when trying to theoretically approach the first-person subjective experience of a human subject. For example, new materialism fails to explain why human minds can maintain the awareness of a subject’s identity throughout their lives and to recall the memories about their past personal experiences.},

We identify three distinct usages of singular they: (1) as a nonbinary personal pronoun, (2) as a universal gender-neutral pronoun, and (3) as an indefinite pronoun when a person’s self-identified gender is unknown. While previous research on singular they as a gender-inclusive language practice has focused primarily on its usage as a nonbinary personal pronoun, our findings point to the relevance for gender politics of all three usages. Our analysis offers new insight into how nonbinary they challenges dominant gender norms and practices beyond incorporating additional gender categories. Given our findings, we propose further investigation of how using gender-neutral pronouns for everyone in specific contexts can advance progressive activists’ goals. Finally, we argue that the longstanding usage of singular they as an indefinite pronoun has new importance today in affirming gender as a self-determined identity.},

Study 2 replicated this finding focusing on Italian and Dutch and using a typicality rating task: socio-cultural and abstract features were considered as more typical of “gender” by Italian than Dutch participants. Study 3 addressed Italian and Dutch participants’ explicit beliefs about gender with a questionnaire measuring essentialism and constructivism, and consolidated results from Studies 1 and 2 showing that Dutch participants endorsed more essentialist beliefs about gender than Italian participants.

Leveraging a Twitter dataset of over 2 billion tweets collected continuously over two years, we find that the public declaration of gender pronouns is on the rise, with most people declaring as using she series pronouns, followed by he series pronouns, and a smaller but considerable amount of non-binary pronouns. From analyzing Twitter posts and sharing activities, we can discern users who use gender pronouns from those who do not and also distinguish users of various gender identities. We further illustrate the relationship between explicit forms of social network exposure to gender pronouns and their eventual gender pronoun adoption. This work carries crucial implications for gender-identity studies and initiates new research directions in gender-related fairness and inclusion, as well as support against online harassment and discrimination on social media.},

	abstract = {The reliance in psychology on verbal definitions means that psychological research is unusually moored to how humans think and communicate about categories. Psychological concepts (e.g., intelligence, attention) are easily assumed to represent objective, definable categories with an underlying essence. Like the “vital forces” previously thought to animate life, these assumed essences can create an illusion of understanding. By synthesizing a wide range of research lines from cognitive, clinical, and biological psychology and neuroscience, we describe a pervasive tendency across psychological science to assume that essences explain phenomena. Labeling a complex phenomenon can appear as theoretical progress before there is sufficient evidence that the described category has a definable essence or known boundary conditions. Category labels can further undermine progress by masking contingent and contextual relationships and obscuring the need to specify mechanisms. Finally, we highlight examples of promising methods that circumvent the lure of essences and suggest four concrete strategies for identifying and avoiding essentialist intuitions in theory development.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this phenomenological study was to describe the role of gender stereotypes and societal expectations in creating impostor syndrome among Black female entrepreneurs. The study used Bandura’s self-efficacy theory as a foundational framework. Gender role theory was employed to examine the psychological and behavioral traits associated with different genders based on societal norms. Social role theory contributed to shaping the theoretical framework of this study. The research answered three key questions: (a) How do the lived experiences of Black female entrepreneurs affected by impostor syndrome impact their business decision-making and overall business performance? (b) To what extent do gender stereotypes and societal pressures contribute to the development of impostor feelings among Black female entrepreneurs? and (c) What coping mechanisms or strategies do Black female entrepreneurs employ to manage or eliminate impostor syndrome? Data collection involved open-ended, semistructured, online, oneon-one interviews. The study revealed that Black female entrepreneurs often face significant challenges in navigating impostor syndrome, which profoundly impacts their decision-making processes and business performance. Future research should explore the efficacy of specific coping mechanisms in mitigating impostor syndrome among Black female entrepreneurs, as well as examine the intersectionality of race, gender, and other identities in shaping experiences of impostor syndrome. Additionally, longitudinal studies are needed to assess the long-term impact of impostor syndrome on business outcomes and identify effective intervention strategies to support Black female entrepreneurs in overcoming impostor feelings and achieving success in their ventures.},

	abstract = {Introduction  There has been increasing attention to—and debate about—best practices related to gender measurement. We add to this conversation by testing whether an approach of providing participants with an extensive list of gender options and then having them self-select into a more limited group of choices (that cohere with the research questions) could be useful.
Methods  In this study of adults (N = 1813), in 2021–2022, we measured gender using a three-part approach: the Gender {EXPAND} ({EXPANsive} responsive {genDer}) approach. Participants were first asked if they identified as transgender. They were then asked their current gender (check all that apply: woman, trans woman, trans feminine, man, trans man, trans masculine, nonbinary or genderqueer, agender, and an option to write in a response). Participants then selected a gender that best fit for them from a limited set of options (transgender, cisgender, nonbinary, unsure).
Results  We evaluated researcher reclassification from the expanded list of gender options compared to participant selfselection from the limited gender categories. We miscategorized 10.5\% of participants when reclassifying their gender from the extensive list of options compared to their self-identification as transgender. We miscategorized 11.2\% of participants compared to participants’ self-selection as cisgender, transgender, nonbinary, or unsure.
Conclusions  Participants generally responded well to the Gender {EXPAND} approach and our transparency in our explanations for our questions. This approach should be refined to reduce misclassification, potentially through different reclassification processes or modified response categories.},

This work reports a high-powered, preregistered study with women that fully replicated Stout and Dasgupta’s findings. Moreover, in an exploratory analysis, we found that, for women, gender-exclusive language is perceived as sexist, which in turn predicted feelings of greater anticipated ostracism, which in turn predicted lower job-based motivation and identification. Therefore, our findings support past research that subtle linguistic cues can be interpreted as exclusionary, that this interpretation can trigger negative outcomes, and that people can experience group-level ostracism based on their social identity.},

We examined the role of familiarity with individuals whose personal pronoun is they and with {LGBTQ}+ communities broadly in the production of singular they. We found that familiarity was a better predictor of variation than age or gender, two variables traditionally associated with language change. Furthermore, modeling the use of they significantly increased its production. Thus, singular specific they can be—and is—acquired both through familiarity with {LGBTQ}+ individuals, as well as through direct exposure to a textual prompt.},

The research was conducted in Polish, a language that is especially challenging for non-binary individuals because it has many gender markers. To avoid using gendered forms, they often use a specific form of passive voice. In an experiment, participants (N = 130, 102 women, 28 men) read a gendered (feminine or masculine) text and a gender-neutral text with passive voice. Most gave a masculine name to the person in the neutral text, but addressed them in a gender-neutral way when asked to react to them in presented scenarios. The gender-neutral text was evaluated as being less comprehensible than the gendered texts, and the non-binary person was rated less competent and colder than a man or a woman and was less socially accepted. Furthermore, the negative evaluation of non-binary people seemed to be attributable to unfamiliarity with genderneutral language and its lower comprehensibility. More research is needed to understand these perceptions better and to be able to prevent their potential negative consequences.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been a notable rise in research interest regarding the integration of gender-inclusive and gender-neutral language in natural language processing models. A specific area of focus that has gained practical and academic significant interest is gender-neutral rewriting, which involves converting binarygendered text to its gender-neutral counterpart. However, current approaches to gender-neutral rewriting for gendered languages tend to rely on large datasets, which may not be an option for languages with fewer resources, such as Portuguese. In this paper, we present a rule-based and a neural-based tool for genderneutral rewriting for Portuguese, a heavily gendered Romance language whose morphology creates different challenges from the ones tackled by other gender-neutral rewriters. Our neural approach relies on fine-tuning large multilingual machine translation models on examples generated by the rule-based model. We evaluate both models on texts from different sources and contexts. We provide the first Portuguese dataset explicitly containing gender-neutral language and neopronouns, as well as a manually annotated golden collection of 500 sentences that allows for evaluation of future work.},

We found that relative to an employee biography with pronouns absent, the inclusion of gender pronouns resulted in more positive organizational attitudes among predominantly cisgender lesbian, gay, and bisexual participants (Experiment 1), as well as transgender and gender non-conforming participants (Experi­ ments 2 \& 3). Moreover, the inclusion of gender pronouns promoted positive organizational attitudes, regardless of whether the disclosure of pronouns was required or optional by the organization (Experiment 3). We also found evidence that the inclusion of pronouns signaled identity-safety via multiple aspects of the organizational environment. That is, the inclusion of pronouns also promoted perceptions the organization was procedurally fair for sexual and gender minorities (Experiment 2 \& 3), as well as perceptions that employees and managers were allies for {LGBTQ}+ employees (Experiment 3); and, each of these perceptions positively related to organizational attitudes. The present experiments demonstrate that the inclusion of gender pronouns effectively signals identitysafety and encourages positive organizational attitudes among {LGBTQ}+ persons.},

We constructed the Gender/Sex Diversity Beliefs Scale ({GSDB}) to assess ontological beliefs about the nature of gender/ sex, including essentialist and social constructionist beliefs, and validated the {GSDB} across a series of studies. In Study 1 (N = 304), we explored the factor structure of the {GSDB} and found evidence of associations with prejudice against transgender and/or nonbinary people. In Study 2 (N = 300), we assessed the stability of the factor structure of the {GSDB} and examined its criterion-related validity, including its relationship to feelings toward multiple gender/sex groups. In Studies 3a (N = 48) and 3b (N = 500), we established test–retest reliability. We conclude that gender/sex diversity beliefs are important for understanding contemporary attitudes about gender/sex, including prejudice against gender/sex minorities, and that the {GSDB} is a reliable and valid way to measure them.},

	abstract = {For a long time, Swedish only had two third-person singular pronouns: hon [‘she’] and han [‘he’]. Following several publications using the gender-neutral pronoun hen to refer to its characters, a debate article in a national newspaper proposed expanding the Swedish pronouns with hen. This proposal ignited a nation-wide debate on the use of a gender-neutral pronoun and its potential consequences. Proponents of hen believed that hen would make the language more gender-fair by making gender less salient, and by having a pronoun for nonbinary gender individuals. Opponents believed hen would confuse children and be trivial for achieving gender equality. This response shows that hen challenges beliefs on what language should look like, how gender is defined, and how gender should be represented in language. In this thesis, I have documented beliefs about hen. I have mapped the initial resistance, and found underlying motivations for different types of criticism. In two experimental studies, I tested whether common arguments in the debate are supported by empirical evidence, and whether hen can affect the way others are perceived.},

While many scholars have studied the effect of media on social and political outcomes, we know surprisingly little about the channels through which this effect operates. I argue that two mechanisms can account for its impact. Media provides new information that persuades individuals to accept it (individual channel), but also, media informs listeners about what others learn, thus facilitating coordination (social channel). Combining a field experiment with a plausibly natural experiment in Mexico, I disentangle these effects analyzing norms surrounding violence against women. I examine the effect of a radio program when it is transmitted privately versus when it is transmitted publicly. I find no evidence supporting the individual mechanism. The social channel, however, increased rejection of violence against women and increased support for gender equality, but unexpectedly increased pessimism about whether violence would decline in the future.},

	abstract = {In many languages with grammatical gender, the use of masculine forms as a generic reference has been associated with a bias favoring masculine-specific representations. This article examines the efficiency of gender-fair forms, specifically gender-unmarked forms (neutralization strategy, e.g., “l'enfant”) and contracted double forms (re-feminization strategy, e.g., “un·e enfant”), in reducing gender biases in language. Extensive empirical research has shown that gender-fair forms have the potential to promote more gender-balanced representations. However, the relative efficiency of these strategies remains a subject of debate in the scientific literature. In order to explore these questions, two experiments were conducted in French. We analyzed the response times and percent correct scores using a sentence evaluation paradigm, where the participants had to decide whether a second sentence starting with a gendered personal pronoun (“il” or “elle”) was a sensible continuation of the first sentence written in a gender-fair form. Experiment 1 confirmed that gender-unmarked forms are not fully effective in neutralizing the masculine bias. In Experiment 2, a comparison was made between gender-unmarked forms and contracted double forms, to assess their respective abilities to generate more balanced representations. The findings indicated that contracted double forms are more effective in promoting gender balance compared to gender-unmarked forms. This study contributes to the existing scientific literature by shedding light on the relative efficiency of neutralization and re-feminization strategies in reducing gender biases in language. These results have implications for informing efforts to promote more inclusive and unbiased language practices.},

The current work represents some of the first quantitative investigations into stereotypes and prejudice directed towards gender non-binary people. In Study 1, 238 cisgender women and 156 cisgender men indicated how they thought cisgender men, cisgender women, gender non-binary people, and binary transgender people were perceived by American society on measures of competence, warmth, identity invalidation, and prejudice. In Study 2, 264 cisgender women and 151 cisgender men indicated how they personally perceived cisgender men, cisgender women, gender non-binary people, and binary transgender people on the same stereotyping and prejudice measures. In Study 3, 206 women and 283 men indicated how they personally perceived either men, women, or gender non-binary people on similar measures. Across all three studies and consistent with hypotheses, gender non-binary people were perceived as less competent, as having less valid identities, and as more likely to experience prejudice than men and women (ps {\textless} .05). Perceptions of warmth were inconsistent across the three studies. In Studies 1 and 2, gender non-binary people were perceived as more competent but as having less valid identities than binary transgender people. Study 3 did not include the binary transgender comparison but added new measures including one regarding perceptions of mental wellbeing and found gender non-binary people were perceived as having worse mental wellbeing than men and women (ps {\textless} .001). Identifying stereotypes surrounding gender non-binary people is an important first step in being able to reduce the bias they face. This work underscores the importance of research on the experiences of gender non-binary people specifically, as opposed to studying their experiences solely within larger umbrella identities such as transgender and gender non-conforming people ({TGNC}).},

Surprisingly, whether the target was transgender or cisgender did not affect these results.

Methods: This study uses thematic analysis on data produced from interviews with 16 participants who self-selected for the study and were recruited from several transgender and {LGBTQ}+ organisations on the basis that they identiﬁed outside the gender binary of male and female. Results: The analysis uncovered several key themes and sub-themes relating to terminology choice, encountering new terms and the process of identifying with new terminology, as well as becoming visible and understood by others. Conclusions: This study found that terminology is not only central in coming to identify as something other than exclusively male and female, it also remains an important factor when it comes to making a non-binary identity visible to others.},

Experiment 1 shows that for both types of pronouns, people use pronouns more in a one-person than a two-person context. In both experiments, people produce nonbinary they at least as frequently as binary pronouns, suggesting that any difficulty does not result in pronoun avoidance in spoken language, even though it does in written language (Arnold et al., 2022). Nevertheless, there is evidence that nonbinary they is somewhat difficult, in that people made gender errors on about 9\% of trials, and they used a more acoustically prominent and disfluent-sounding pronunciation for nonbinary pronouns than binary pronouns.

This distinction is thought to be important because it has been proposed that confirmatory hypothesis tests provide more compelling results (less uncertain, less tentative, less open to bias) than exploratory hypothesis tests. In this article, we challenge this proposition and argue that there are several advantages of exploratory hypothesis tests that can make their results more compelling than those of confirmatory hypothesis tests. We also consider some potential disadvantages of exploratory hypothesis tests and conclude that their advantages can outweigh the disadvantages. We conclude that exploratory hypothesis tests avoid researcher commitment and researcher prophecy biases, reduce the probability of data fraud, are more appropriate in the context of unplanned deviations, facilitate inference to the best explanation, and allow peer reviewers to make additional contributions at the data analysis stage. In contrast, confirmatory hypothesis tests may lead to an inappropriate level of confidence in research conclusions, less appropriate analyses in the context of unplanned deviations, and greater bias and errors in theore­ tical inferences.},

But despite authoritarianism’s unique ability to explain present political dynamics, scholars have devoted too little attention to this operationalization’s measurement properties. We address these and other issues here. We demonstrate that (1) the childrearing measure taps authoritarianism, (2) it is exogenous to a wide range of political attitudes, (3) its temporal stability is consistent with its conceptualization as a personality adaptation and (4) adding new items to the existing set improves our ability to measure authoritarianism. We thus provide scholars with a measure that better explains political opinions, which should allow future work to better identify when, how, and among whom authoritarianism explains political thinking.},

	abstract = {This study contributes to the emerging literature on gender identity and pronoun use by exploring strategies to refer to unknown human referents. In an online survey involving mainly a university population aged 29 and below, participants were first asked to pick a potential roommate from two fictional characters with gender-ambiguous names and write short answers explaining their choice. Secondly, participants were explicitly asked what pronoun they would use to refer to an unknown human referent from a list of neopronouns in addition to singular they. The results show a strong association between participants’ selfidentified gender and the gendered pronoun used. The results also show singular they is the most popular gender-inclusive pronoun for an unknown individual while pronoun avoidance strategies include repeating names and using generic nouns. Additionally, the reflexive form themself is preferred over themselves for unknown human referents, in contrast to previous research showing almost the same rate of naturalness for themselves and themself in the specific-reference context.},

	abstract = {The American Psychological Association’s (Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, American Psychological Association, 2019) style manual recently updated its guidelines to include the use they/them/their pronouns for situations where gender is unknown or irrelevant, which includes situations involving cisgender men and women. As such, we experimentally tested whether non-binary pronouns (“they/them/their”) would function as generic and inclusive singular pronouns for cisgender men and women. As a replication and extension of previous research (i.e., Crawford and English in J Psycholinguist Res 13 (5):373–3381, https://doi.org/ 10.1007/{BF}01068152, 1984; Stout and Dasgupta in Personal Soc Psychol Bull 37 (6):757–769, https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167211406434, 2011), cisgender U.S. college students (N = 381; 269 women and 112 men; M age = 19.41 years old) were randomly assigned to read a job advertisement using: (1) masculine pronouns “he/ him/his”, (2) binary pronouns such as “she or he”, or (3) singular non-binary pronouns “they/them/their”. Participants’ memory for the content of the job advertisement was tested along with assessments of sexism and belongingness (i.e., ostracism or feelings of exclusion, whether they identified with the described job, and whether they would be motivated for the work). As predicted, there were gender differences in memory scores in the masculine (men scored higher) and binary (women scored higher) pronoun conditions, but not in the non-binary condition. For all three indicators of belongingness, as predicted, men’s belongingness scores were similar across the three conditions (i.e., men were included or represented by the pronouns used in all three conditions), whereas women’s scores indicated less belongingness when masculine condition pronouns were used (i.e., where women were excluded by the pronouns used) in comparison to when the binary and non-binary pronoun were used (i.e., where women were included by the pronouns used). Together these findings provide empirical support for the use of “they/them/their” as singular nonbinary pronouns to refer generically and inclusively to both cisgender men and women.},
